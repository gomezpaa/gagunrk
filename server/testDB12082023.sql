Trump declared “the dawn of a new Middle East.” Those words rang hollow to many in the region, though. Even in the countries that signed the deals, branded the Abraham Accords, support for the Palestinians — and enmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of their land — remained strong, particularly as Israel’s government expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were celebrations — even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were killed and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened a “long and difficult war” ahead. “This is the first time that we rejoice in this way for our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdul Majeed Abdullah Hassan, 70, who joined a rally with hundreds of people in the island kingdom of Bahrain. In the context of the Israeli occupation and blockade, the Hamas operation “warmed our hearts,” he said, calling his government’s deal to recognize Israel “shameful.” Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen, Tunisia and Kuwait. In Lebanon, Hashem Safieddine, head of the executive council for the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, delivered a fiery speech lauding “the era of armed resistance.” And in Egypt’s coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian. The ripples spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of the Middle East, and Israel’s position in the region will remain unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues. Diplomatic “normalization” agreements between Israel and Arab governments — even with the powerhouse of Saudi Arabia, where American officials have been pushing recently for normalization — will do little to change that, many regional analysts say. “The current war is a stark reminder that lasting peace and prosperity in the region is only possible after resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” said Bader Al-Saif, a professor at Kuwait University. “No amount of heavy lifting or acrobatics in dealing with Israel on other files can sidestep or erase this simple fact.” Many Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, have long insisted that the price of recognizing Israel must be the creation of a Palestinian state. But over the past decade, that calculus has shifted, as authoritarian leaders weigh negative public opinion toward a relationship with Israel against the economic and security benefits it could offer — and what they might be able to get from the United States in return. The Biden administration has been pressing for a deal that would establish ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia in exchange for significant concessions to the kingdom. Saudi officials have demanded American security assurances and support for a civilian nuclear program.  Last month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia made his first public reference to the negotiations, saying in a Fox News interview that the talks felt “real” for the first time. And in early October, the kingdom’s newspapers — which operate under limited press freedom — began publishing a spate of columns that were subtly or openly supportive of normalization. The eruption of violence on Saturday presented a significant challenge to those efforts. It also made comments by King Abdullah II of Jordan at a conference in New York last month appear prescient: “This belief by some in the region that you can parachute over Palestine — deal with the Arabs and work your way back — that does not work,” he said. Indeed, some Arab officials and scholars complain that their warnings about normalization deals that do not sincerely address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have fallen on deaf ears. Watching the events in Gaza feels like hearing Arabs say “we told you so” to the American president, Khalid al-Dakhil, a prominent Saudi academic, wrote on the social media platform X. “Ignoring what’s right in finding a just solution to the Palestinian cause creates a trap for the region and threatens peace,” he said. American officials say that normalization is a key step toward a more integrated Middle East, with positive implications for regional security and American defense interests. “There are really two paths before the region,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “There’s the path of greater integration, greater stability, including, critically, making sure that Israelis and Palestinians resolve their differences, or there’s the path of terror that Hamas is engaged on, that has not improved the lives of a single person.” He added: “We’ve said from day one that even as we’re working toward normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that can’t be a substitute for resolving the differences between Israelis and Palestinians.” But many in the region say that normalization feels like a betrayal: a triumph of government and business elites over the will of their people. The Palestinian cause “is something we grew up on as children, and it became a compass to show what is right and just,” said Reem Maraj, 34, who participated in a symposium on Saturday in Bahrain that discussed the outcome of the Abraham Accords, three years later. “If I had the choice, I would have erased this agreement from the history of my country,” she said. Polls show that even in Arab countries that have relations with Israel, a majority of citizens view the Abraham Accords negatively. “We stand fully with the rights of the Palestinian people to free their land,” said Hassan Bennajeh, one of the organizers of protests in Morocco. “We are asking to end the normalization because it doesn’t reflect the opinion of Moroccans.” The Qatar Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that it holds Israel “solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.” The government of Iran, which for years has been engaged in a shadow war with Israel and has supported Hamas, cheered the group’s attack on Israel on Saturday. And Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said on local television last night that his country “has been warning, for months, of the danger of provocative practices” by Israel. “The ongoing occupation and dehumanization of Palestinians has been on full display for decades and it has shaped the way Arabs view the conflict,” said Mr. Al-Saif, the Kuwaiti professor. “Palestine is the priority of the Arab street.” Even so, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, predicted that a deal between Saudi Arabia, the United States and Israel was likely to move ahead. “I would bet my money on it,” he said. “If the right price comes across from the Americans, I think the Saudis have their national interest as No. 1 priority.” The violence in Israel “might derail things for a while, but it’s not going to reverse the appetite for normalization with Israel and de-escalating — a new Middle East,” he said. On Sunday morning, another signal arrived in a major Saudi-owned newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat. In a column, Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper’s former editor, criticized Hamas and Palestinian factions for waging what he called a “useless war.” He accused them of trying to sabotage the prospects for Saudi-Israeli normalization — and of serving their Iranian backers at the expense of the Palestinian people. “Iran does not want to see real peace, or specifically Saudi-Israeli peace,” he wrote. “Because if it happens, it will be the peace that will change the face of the region.” '),(2,'The Global Context of the Hamas-Israel War','The Hamas attack is a sign of a new world order.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/briefing/hamas-israel-war.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:28:00 +0000','Russia has started the largest war in Europe since World War II. China has become more bellicose toward Taiwan. India has embraced a virulent nationalism. Israel has formed the most extreme government in its history. And on Saturday morning, Hamas brazenly attacked Israel, launching thousands of missiles and publicly kidnapping and killing civilians. All these developments are signs that the world may have fallen into a new period of disarray. Countries — and political groups like Hamas — are willing to take big risks, rather than fearing that the consequences would be too dire. The simplest explanation is that the world is in the midst of a transition to a new order that experts describe with the word multipolar. The United States is no longer the dominant power it once was, and no replacement has emerged. As a result, political leaders in many places feel emboldened to assert their own interests, believing the benefits of aggressive action may outweigh the costs. These leaders believe that they have more sway over their own region than the U.S. does. “A fully multipolar world has emerged, and people are belatedly realizing that multipolarity involves quite a bit of chaos,” Noah Smith wrote in his Substack newsletter on Saturday. Zheng Yongnian, a Chinese political scientist with ties to the country’s leaders, has similarly described the “old order” as disintegrating. “Countries are brimming with ambition, like tigers eyeing their prey, keen to find every opportunity among the ruins of the old order,” Zheng wrote last year. Why has American power receded? Some of the change is unavoidable. Dominant countries don’t remain dominant forever. But the U.S. has also made strategic mistakes that are accelerating the arrival of a multipolar world. Among those mistakes: Presidents of both parties naïvely believed that a richer China would inevitably be a friendlier China — and failed to recognize that the U.S. was building up its own rival through lenient trade policies, as the political scientist John Mearsheimer has argued. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. spent much of the early 21st century fighting costly wars. The Iraq war was especially damaging because it was an unprovoked war that George W. Bush chose to start. And the humiliating retreat from Afghanistan, overseen by President Biden, made the U.S. look weaker still. Perhaps the biggest damage to American prestige has come from Donald Trump, who has rejected the very idea that the U.S. should lead the world. Trump withdrew from international agreements and disdained successful alliances like NATO. He has signaled that, if he reclaims the presidency in 2025, he may abandon Ukraine. In the case of Israel, Trump encouraged Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, to show little concern for Palestinian interests and instead seek a maximal Israeli victory. Netanyahu, of course, did not start this new war. Hamas did, potentially with support from Iran, the group’s longtime backer, and Hamas committed shocking human rights violations this past weekend, captured on video. But Netanyahu’s extremism has contributed to the turmoil between Israel and Palestinian groups like Hamas. An editorial in Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, yesterday argued, “The prime minister, who has prided himself on his vast political experience and irreplaceable wisdom in security matters, completely failed to identify the dangers he was consciously leading Israel into when establishing a government of annexation and dispossession.” Netanyahu, Haaretz added, adopted “a foreign policy that openly ignored the existence and rights of Palestinians.” Even with the rise of multipolarity, the U.S. remains the world’s most powerful country, with a unique ability to forge alliances and peace. In the Middle East, the Trump administration persuaded Israel and four other countries — the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco — to sign unprecedented diplomatic agreements, known as the Abraham Accords. In recent months, the Biden administration has made progress toward an even more ambitious deal, between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Hamas attacked Israel in part to undermine an Israeli-Saudi deal, many experts believe. Such a deal could isolate Iran, Hamas’s patron, and could lead to an infusion of Saudi money for the Palestinian Authority, a more moderate group than Hamas (as Thomas Friedman explains in this column). But if the recent Hamas attacks lead Israel to reduce the Gaza Strip to rubble in response, Saudi Arabia will have a hard time agreeing to any treaty. “This will slow considerably if not kill the Saudi Abraham Accords deal,” Mara Rudman, a former U.S. diplomat, told The Times. In these ways, you can think of Hamas’s attacks as an attempt to prevent a reassertion of American power — and instead to continue pushing the world toward multipolarity. I understand that some readers may question whether the long era of American power that’s now fading was worth celebrating. Without question, it included some terrible injustices, be they in Vietnam, Iran, Guatemala or elsewhere. But it also made possible the most peaceful era in recorded history, with a sharp decline in deaths from violence, as Steven Pinker noted in his 2011 book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature.” And the number of people living in a democracy surged.

'),(3,'Scalise, a McCarthy Rival, Seeks to Unite Republicans in Taking His Place','The second-ranking Republican, who was cut out of major decisions by the previous speaker, is pitching himself as uniquely positioned to unify the deeply divided House G.O.P.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/politics/scalise-speaker-mccarthy-jordan.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:02:14 +0000','When Harriet M. Hageman announced her 2022 primary challenge against Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, House Republican leaders quickly endorsed her bid to oust a colleague whose condemnations of former President Donald J. Trump had made her a pariah in her own party. But one member of leadership remained notably silent: Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican. He viewed backing Ms. Hageman as a violation of what he calls his 11th Commandment, borrowed from President Ronald Reagan: “Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.” He waited until Ms. Hageman had defeated Ms. Cheney to throw his support behind her. Mr. Scalise, a longtime rival to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is now mounting his own bid for the post. He has pitched himself as the man uniquely positioned to unite Republicans at a moment when they are deeply divided and demoralized after Mr. McCarthy’s historic ouster last week. “We’re so divided; he can unite this Congress,” Representative Lance Gooden of Texas said of Mr. Scalise. His candidacy is the culmination of a steady political climb for a deeply conservative Republican who once described himself, according to a local columnist, as “like David Duke without the baggage.” In Louisiana, Mr. Scalise represents the First Congressional District, a place where the fossil fuel industry is king, and where conservatism is rooted in the myth of rugged individualism — and, at least in some quarters, a politics of racial resentment. It is where Mr. Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, was elected to the State Legislature in 1989. Mr. Scalise has suggested that his life and political career have been influenced by those forces. He made the remark comparing himself to Mr. Duke to Stephanie Grace, now a columnist for The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate newspaper, when she first met Mr. Scalise in the 1990s. She wrote that Mr. Scalise’s point “was that the actual governmental philosophy Duke espoused isn’t far off from what was becoming mainstream conservative thought, what with its suspicion of taxes, set-asides and safety net programs such as welfare.” (Over the weekend, Ms. Grace endorsed Mr. Scalise for speaker.) Decades later, those views are as powerful as ever in the Republican Party as Mr. Scalise faces off for the speakership against Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founder of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Scalise is making the run despite having been diagnosed only weeks ago with blood cancer, for which he has been undergoing treatment. His supporters insist it has not diminished his capacity for the job. A key plank of Mr. Scalise’s pitch to his colleagues is that he is a fund-raising powerhouse, second only to Mr. McCarthy. He has raised nearly $170 million over the course of his congressional career to help Republicans win elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, Mr. Scalise spent 112 days on the road campaigning for members and candidates. Over the past five years, his office said, he has given $7.2 million directly to Republican members and candidates and transferred $50 million to the National Republican Campaign Committee. “Kevin McCarthy was fabulous at raising the resources our conference needed,” said Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri. “The only person second to that is Steve Scalise.” Ms. Wagner, a longtime ally of Mr. Scalise, said she had accompanied him on fund-raising swings in which he visited more than a dozen districts in three days. Over the past year, Mr. Scalise has been marginalized by Mr. McCarthy, who has privately described him to colleagues as ineffective, checked out and reluctant to take positions, and cut him out of all major decision making. The dynamic was frustrating for Mr. Scalise at the time. But now, his allies believe that the fact that he was not involved in the debt ceiling negotiations with President Biden, which ultimately proved to be a catalyst for Mr. McCarthy’s downfall, could make him a viable option for the hard-right members who rebelled against the former speaker. While most far-right Republicans are expected to back Mr. Jordan on Tuesday when they are scheduled to choose a nominee for speaker, Mr. Scalise is imploring them to support him as a second choice. Under the current rules of the Republican conference, whoever receives a majority in that secret-ballot vote will be the party’s nominee when the full House meets to elect a new speaker, now expected on Wednesday. Lawmakers allied with Mr. Jordan are trying to raise that threshold to unanimity, which would put Mr. Scalise at a disadvantage. For now, however, Mr. Scalise has been telling right-wing lawmakers that while he wishes he could be their first choice, he hopes that if he emerges as the nominee, they will at least vote for him on the floor. His pitch to other Republicans is more straightforward. Mr. Jordan, who has been endorsed for the speakership by Mr. Trump, would have a more difficult time helping vulnerable Republicans win in districts President Biden won in 2020, especially when Mr. Jordan supported primary opponents for 12 sitting members of Congress. Mr. Scalise arrived on Capitol Hill in 2008, after winning a special election to replace Representative Bobby Jindal, who was elected governor. A political animal since childhood, he came to Washington wanting to be a part of everything: He joined the Bible study group and the congressional baseball team, where he would play in a Louisiana State University baseball jersey and buy tickets for all of his staff members and their kids. He pushed for a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he became a strong ally of the oil and gas industry. And he quickly rose to become the recruitment chair of the National Republican Campaign Committee and then chairman of the Republican Study Committee, then the largest group of conservative House Republicans. Mr. Scalise, the first person in his family to graduate from college, grew up in Jefferson Parish, in the suburbs just outside of New Orleans, a region where the population ballooned in the latter half of the last century as white residents fled the desegregating city. Born into a family of Sicilian immigrants, Mr. Scalise used to tell staff members stories about how his ancestors worked in the sugar fields in Garyville, La. His rise in Washington was rapid. By 2014, he had ascended to the No. 3 position in the House. Then a blogger broke the story that as a state legislator in 2002, Mr. Scalise had spoken at a meeting of a white nationalist group founded by Mr. Duke, a revelation that threatened to derail his political career. Under intense pressure from Democrats to step down, Mr. Scalise said the speech was a “mistake I regret,” claiming he did not realize what the group was when he accepted the invitation. At the time, he received a significant nod of support from his old friend Cedric Richmond, then a congressman from New Orleans, who is Black. “I don’t think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,” Mr. Richmond said then. (Mr. Richmond could not be reached for comment about Mr. Scalise’s run for the speakership.) In 2020, Mr. Scalise voted to remove Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol, breaking with a majority of his party, including Mr. Jordan. Still, Mr. Scalise most often sides with Republicans. He pushed hard for the passage of legislation in 2015 that resulted in the repeal of a 40-year ban on oil exports, handing the oil industry a huge victory. He also played a major role in 2017 in muscling through Republicans’ $1.5 trillion tax cut law, which primarily benefited big corporations, multimillionaires and other wealthy individuals. A supporter of Mr. Trump, he voted to overturn the 2020 election results and for months afterward steadfastly promoted the lie that the election had been stolen. In 2017, Mr. Scalise was gravely wounded when a gunman, distraught over Mr. Trump’s election, opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team at a practice. The bullet tore up his internal organs, shattered bones and caused major internal bleeding, leaving Mr. Scalise in critical condition. He had to undergo multiple surgeries and months of work at an inpatient rehabilitation center to relearn how to walk. He returned to the Capitol three months later, walking gingerly with two canes. “I’m definitely a living example that miracles really do happen,” he said at the time. Today, Mr. Scalise appears almost fully healed. With the help of a shoe with a lifted sole, his gait is now normal. In August, Mr. Scalise announced that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer but planned to return to Washington to continue working as he underwent several months of treatment. Colleagues said that part of his pitch to them over the past few days was that the treatment was going better than his doctors had anticipated and he was in shape to do the job. “They have changed his treatment and shortened into a three-month period of time, down from six,” said Ms. Wagner, a close friend. Both Mr. Scalise’s wife, Jennifer, and his doctors, she added, “have agreed that he’s more than healthy enough for this challenge.” It is not clear precisely what toll his illness and treatment have taken on Mr. Scalise. He has taken to wearing a heavy-duty mask at news conferences and on the House floor, a striking change for a Republican who eschewed a face covering as the coronavirus pandemic raged, once calling federal mask mandates “Democrats’ masking political theater.” '),(4,'Russia’s Economy Is Increasingly Structured Around Its War in Ukraine','The nation’s finances have proven resilient, despite punishing sanctions, giving it leeway to pump money into its military machine.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/russia-economy-ukraine-war.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:02:04 +0000','“Everything needed for the front,” Russia’s finance minister declared, echoing a Soviet slogan from World War II as he talked about the government’s latest spending plans. The government still calls its invasion of Ukraine a “special military operation,” but the new budget figures make clear that the economy is increasingly being restructured around war. Nearly a third of the country’s spending next year — roughly $109 billion — will be devoted to “national defense,” the government announced late last month, redirecting money that might otherwise have flowed to health care, education, roads and other sectors. More tellingly, 6 percent of the nation’s total output is being funneled toward Russia’s war machine, more than double what it was before the invasion. Since Russia sent soldiers across the border in February 2022, its economy has had to adapt to dramatic changes with astonishing speed. The European Union, its biggest trading partner, quickly broke economic relations, upending well-established supply chains and reliable sources of income from abroad. The United States used its financial might to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian assets and cut the country off from the global financial system. Nineteen months later, the economic picture is decidedly mixed. The Russian economy has proved to be much more resilient than many Western governments assumed after imposing a punishing string of sanctions. Moscow has found other buyers for its oil. It has pumped money into the economy at a rapid pace to finance its military machine, putting almost every available worker into a job and raising the size of weekly paychecks. Total output, which the Russian Central Bank estimates may rise as much as 2.5 percent this year, could outpace the European Union and possibly even the United States. Yet that is only part of the story. As Laura Solanko, a senior adviser at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, said: “When a country is at war, gross domestic product is a fairly poor measure of welfare.” Producing bullets adds to a country’s growth rate without necessarily improving the quality of life. The insistent demand for foreign currency — to pay for imported goods or provide a safe investment — has also caused the value of the ruble to sink at a precipitous pace. Last week, it fell to a symbolic break point of 100 to the dollar, further fueling inflation and raising anxiety levels among consumers. The spike in government spending and borrowing has seriously stressed an already overheated economy. The central bank rapidly raised interest rates to 13 percent over the summer, as annual inflation continued to climb. Higher rates, which make it more expensive for businesses to expand and consumers to buy on credit, is likely to slow growth. Consumers are also feeling the squeeze for daily purchases. “Dairy products, especially butter, meat and even bread have gone up in price,” said Lidia Adreevna as she shopped and examined prices at an Auchan supermarket in Moscow. She blamed the central bank. “Life changes,” she offered, “nothing stays forever, not love, or happiness.” Other pensioners at the store also spoke about increases in meat and poultry prices, something almost half of Russians have noticed in the past month, according to survey data from the Moscow-based Public Opinion Foundation published Friday. Respondents also noted increases in the price of medicine and construction materials. Moscow imposed a temporary ban on diesel and gasoline exports last month in an effort to ease shortages and slow rising energy prices, but the restrictions further reduced the amount of foreign currency coming into the country. The exodus of funds is so worrying that the government has warned of reinstating controls on money leaving the country. With a presidential election scheduled in March, President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged last month that accelerating inflation fueled by a weakened ruble was a major cause of concern. Getting a handle on price increases may discourage the government from embarking on its usual pre-election social spending. Lower standards of living can be “uncomfortable even for an authoritarian government,” said Charles Lichfield, deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Geoeconomics Center. Since Russia imports a wide range of goods — from telephones and washing machines to cars, medicine and coffee — he said a devalued ruble makes “it more difficult for consumers to buy what they’re used to buying.” The United States, the European Union and countries allied with Ukraine have doggedly tried to cripple Russia with sweeping sanctions. The impact was swift and sharp in the spring of 2022. The ruble tumbled, the central bank increased rates to 20 percent to attract investors, and the government imposed strict controls on capital to keep money inside the country. But the ruble has since bounced back and interest rates come down. Russia found eager buyers elsewhere for its oil, which was selling at vastly discounted prices; liquefied natural gas; and other raw materials. More recently, Russia has become adept at evading the $60 per barrel price cap on oil imposed by the Group of 7 nations as global oil prices have once again started to rise. China is among the nations that have stepped up to buy energy and sell goods to Russia that they previously might have exchanged with European nations. Trade with China rose at an annual rate of 32 percent in the first eight months of this year. Trade with India tripled in the first half of the year, and exports from Turkey rose nearly 89 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, the war is gobbling up other parts of Russia’s budget aside from direct military spending. An additional 9.2 percent of the budget is slated for “national security,” which includes law enforcement. There is money for injured soldiers and for families of those killed in battle, and for “integrating new regions,” a reference to occupied territory in Ukraine. Sergei Guriev, a Russian economist who fled the country in 2013 and is now provost at Sciences Po in Paris, said accurately assessing the Russian economy is difficult. The existing economic models were designed before the war and based on different assumptions, and the published budget figures are incomplete. What that means for Russian households on a daily basis is harder to discern. “Overall, it’s very hard to compare quality of life before and after the war,” Mr. Guriev said. “It’s hard to know what Russians think. People are afraid.” '),(5,'Zelensky Compares Hamas’s Assault on Israel to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine','The Ukrainian president said in a speech to NATO that “terror will have no allies” if the world unites against hostage-taking and other acts of aggression.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-russia-israel.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:25:40 +0000','President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Monday condemned Hamas for its surprise assault on Israel and likened the attack to Russia’s invasion of his own country. In a speech to NATO, he also criticized Iran for its support of Hamas and Moscow. It is the second speech that Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday, has delivered in support of Israel since Hamas’s incursion into Israel. In another sign of the Ukrainian government’s strong backing for Israel, electronic billboards in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, were lighted with the Israeli flag on Sunday night. Mr. Zelensky said that Hamas and Moscow were “the same evil, and the only difference is that there is a terrorist organization that attacked Israel, and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine.” “If the world unites whenever someone takes women hostage and condemns the children of another nation, terror will have no allies,” he said in a speech delivered by video link to a meeting in Copenhagen of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. “The intentions declared are different, but the essence is the same. You see it in the same blood on the streets,” he said. Mr. Zelensky compared the killings of civilians in Israel in recent days to those in the city of Bucha, northeast of Kyiv, in the early weeks of Russia’s invasion last year. Hundreds of Ukrainians were tortured or killed there in a series of atrocities being investigated as war crimes. In an impassioned speech to the NATO assembly, Mr. Zelensky also singled out Iran for its sale to Moscow of exploding drones, thousands of which have been launched at Ukraine on the battlefield and in civilian areas. He noted that Iranian officials had also expressed support for Hamas. The war in Israel comes more than four months into a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces that has yet to achieve a decisive breakthrough and when Kyiv is looking to shore up support among its allies in NATO amid signs that some have wavered. Analysts have argued that visible success on the battlefield would make it easier for Ukraine to maintain its international network of support. President Biden said last week that he was confident that Congress would approve military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine “for as long as it takes” despite of opposition among some Republicans. His comments were an attempt to reassure Ukraine’s allies after the House passed a stopgap spending bill that did not include any additional money for Kyiv. At the same time, voters in Slovakia, an eastern European state with historical ties to Moscow, elected a party led by Robert Fico, a former prime minister whohad taken a pro-Russian stance during the campaign. In tandem with bitter fighting on the front lines, Russian forces have kept up a daily barrage of missile, drone and artillery strikes against Ukraine. In recent weeks, that has included a renewed assault on the country’s energy infrastructure, a strategy that Russia employed to devastating effect last winter. On the battlefield, Russian troops fired on eight of Ukraine’s regions over the past 24 hours, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, targeting dozens of villages. One woman was killed in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, local authorities said. In Kherson region in the south, the site of some of the most fearsome attacks, one person was killed and 18 others were wounded including two children, according to the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Prokudin. '),(6,'Grizzlies Are Increasing in Numbers. Learning to Live With Them.','Montana and its neighbors are adopting new strategies to deal with the increasing number of bears and attacks on humans.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/science/grizzly-bear-attacks-control.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:01:24 +0000','Aries, an Anatolian shepherd, warily watches a stranger approach a pen where he and other members of his family — including eight fuzzy, 2-month-old puppies — roam alongside a grunting pig and several bleating goats. Livestock guard dogs like Aries are in demand in Montana these days, an important tool as the state deals with an increasing number of grizzly bears. Anatolians — large, muscular dogs that originated in Turkey and were bred by shepherds — are extremely loyal and highly protective of those in their care, even against top predators. “We have gray wolves, grizzly and black bears here,” said Natalie Thurman, owner of Apex Anatolians, whose pups go for $3,300 each. “We just had a grizzly bear in the creek a hundred yards from here.” While she markets the dogs primarily to people who raise livestock, she also sells them to people with children. “They take them on hikes, they take them camping,” Ms. Thurman said. “They tell you when a bear is coming. I can replace livestock, but you can’t replace a human child.” Grizzly bears are a daily concern for residents in the northern Rockies. The bears no longer live only in the remote high country, in parks, wilderness and surrounding areas. Instead, they have increasingly moved into the valleys and prairies to reclaim portions of their old realm. They wander onto golf courses, break into homes, stalk chicken coops and raid cornfields. Montana is home to 2,100 grizzlies, by far the most in the lower 48 states, with much smaller populations mainly in Idaho and Wyoming. Grizzly bear attacks frequently make headlines in this part of the country. Amie Adamson, a 47-year-old Kansas resident, was killed by a grizzly in July as she jogged near Yellowstone National Park. That bear and its cub were captured and euthanized later in the summer after they broke into a cabin and stole dog food. Last year, Craig Clouatre, 40, of Montana, was killed by a grizzly as he searched for antlers shed by elk near Yellowstone. In mid-September of this year, a hunter was mauled in Custer Gallatin National Forest in southwestern Montana. And just last weekend, a couple and their dog were killed by what officials described as an aggressive grizzly bear in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. It was euthanized. Sales of bear spray, which contains capsaicin, the chemical that gives peppers their spicy heat, are booming. Many hikers, picnickers, ranchers and hunters — just about anyone who spends time outdoors in bear habitats — pack bear spray these days. Fall is when the possibility of conflicts peaks. Bears become especially ravenous — a period called hyperphagia — when they are driven to eat far more than they do the rest of the year, to bulk up fat reserves to live on during several months of hibernation. While black bears, which are also found in the region, attack people, grizzly bears pose a different order of threat — they are generally bigger and more defensive, especially when surprised or when their cubs seem threatened. A black bear will usually scramble off, but a grizzly will more often stand its ground. The grizzly has been listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in the northern Rockies since 1975, when its population in Yellowstone and Glacier totaled several hundred bears. They have come back in the last half century, with about 1,000 bears in each park and their surrounding ecosystems, and more outside those core areas. Biologists, conservationists and others hope that as the grizzly population expands, the areas between the five island ecosystems with a good bear habitat in the northern tier of the United States — Yellowstone and Glacier, the Cabinet-Yaak Valley, the Selkirk Mountains in Idaho and the North Cascades in Washington — will become bear-friendly. That would allow grizzlies to move between them, assuring a healthy flow of genetic diversity to help bears adapt to climate and other changes, and ensure their future. Much of the territory they once inhabited, however, is crisscrossed with roads and crowded with people who are plopping down homes. Subdivisions, towns, cities, cattle and sheep are spread across the bears’ terrain, and an increase in recreation on public lands brings large numbers of people onto their turf. And so a grand experiment is underway to manage the human world in such a way that an apex predator and people in a large urban and suburban complex surrounded by large swaths of public land, can coexist with few conflicts. The future of the bear is at stake, experts say. Although there is a lot of support for bears in the region, attacks on livestock and people can undermine it. There is plenty of anti-grizzly sentiment as well. The state of Montana has petitioned the federal government to have the bear stripped of its protected status so that ranchers can shoot them if their livestock are threatened. Others would like to see the bear hunted. The growing number of attacks has also prompted the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Wildlife Services, which has long existed to kill nuisance wildlife, to research nonlethal methods of managing the bears, including remotely activated sound devices, flashing ear tags and drones with thermal imaging that watch livestock night and day, and harass approaching predators. Of course, confrontations with grizzlies and other bears occur in many other parts of the world where people and bears are moving into each other’s turf. This spring, a jogger was killed as he ran near Trento, Italy, in the Alps, where a population of Marsican brown bears are being restored. China, Japan and other Asian countries have reported similar conflicts and attacks. Western Montana has adopted a preventive approach called Bear Smart, a concept that began in British Columbia. It focuses on identifying and eliminating things that hungry bears are attracted to — garbage, compost, bee hives and fruit and vegetable gardens. Russell Talmo, a specialist in conflict prevention and a member of the conservation nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, helps landowners in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington apply for cost-sharing grants to install electric fences around their chicken coops, beehives and garbage facilities. “A fed bear is a dead bear,” he said. “Once a bear gets a taste of the good life, they can be ruined for life.” At the Clark Fork School, on the edge of Missoula, Mr. Talmo pointed to a newly installed electric fence. “It’s smack in the heart of the Rattlesnake Valley, which is chock-full of black bears,” he said, as preschool children played nearby. Mr. Talmo’s interest is more than professional — his 2-year-old son, Luther, attends the school. Officials installed an electric fence around the school’s chicken coop and vegetable garden with a timer that turns it on in the evening. Mr. Talmo spends a lot of time talking to people about ways to deter bears from getting too close. Some are simple measures, like putting away bird seed or locking up dog food. People also should keep their doors securely closed, which usually — but not always — prevents bears from getting in. “Breaking-and-entering bears are a real thing,” he said. Once dotted with orchards, the Missoula Valley is still home to plenty of fruit trees that bears frequent, especially in several large drainage areas that funnel bears to the valley bottom where they eat fallen apples. Fruit-growers in the region are urged to pick their apples quickly. The Great Bear Foundation, a conservation nonprofit, has a program that connects people with volunteers who will help with the harvest. The apples are then donated to local food banks, as well as to a cidery that brews a cider named for the foundation. “If everyone secures their food, they may pass through town, but they will not stay,” said Elissa Chott, who runs the program. “Grizzly bears are good at avoiding people,” said Christopher Servheen, a biologist who led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service effort to restore the grizzly bear population in the lower 48 states from 1981 to 2016. He now works as a consultant on bear issues. “The only ones that are alive are good at avoiding people,” Dr. Servheen said. “Bears have a culture, and one generation passes down behavior to the next. So they raise cubs that avoid people.” But if they learn that easy meals can be found in a dumpster, they can pass that knowledge on as well. Though black bears are the big problem now in the Missoula Valley, their presence represents a kind of dress rehearsal for the grizzlies that occupy territory all around the city. “They have Missoula hemmed in and are making forays around the edges,” Mr. Talmo said. “By addressing the black bear problem, you are getting ahead of the grizzly bears that are coming.” Mr. Talmo visited a homestead recently where a grizzly was spotted along Kendall Creek, just east of Missoula, very near to a chicken coop owned by Kathy Ream. Even though her modest home is very close to the bears’ travel corridor, she said she was not worried about having a grizzly in her backyard. “No, I love it,” Ms. Ream said. “I’m really happy about it. It means we’re wilding a little bit.” Even with the focus on eliminating certain elements that attract bears, they still get into trouble. Jamie Jonkel, a bear management specialist with the Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks department in Missoula, gets summoned to deal with all sorts of situations. A new bear-resistant garbage can or electric fencing may solve a problem, but bears may have to be trapped and moved. Aversive conditioning is also deployed to retrain bears that no longer fear people. Mr. Jonkel and his colleagues fire bean bags and rubber bullets at bears in hopes of restoring healthy levels of fear. “If we get a bear lost in town, confused, comes in for chokecherries, but gets lost in humanity, we will trap or dart and relocate,” Mr. Jonkel said. “But for a bear getting into garbage, breaking into houses, chasing livestock, that’s when it goes management. Most of the time we trap and relocate, or trap and aversive condition.” A last resort is euthanasia. Beyond cities and towns, rural regions are also changing tactics. The Blackfoot Valley near Missoula has pioneered efforts to keep bears and people apart. Dead livestock, once left on the land, are carted off to a compost facility. Dozens of ranchers have electric fences around their home and ranch facilities. Range riders on horseback mind the sheep and cattle. The specially bred guard dogs live with the livestock. Some are deployed in layering system of different breeds — “sticky” breeds stay close to the flock or herd while other breeds patrol the perimeter. Some owners put sharply spiked collars on their dogs’ necks that would injure a bear or wolf that bites the dogs. Hannah Ollenburger, a researcher in Sheridan, Mont., who studies the role of livestock guard dogs in predator management and is the author of “The Atlas of Conflict Reduction,” called it operant conditioning. “You are shaping the behavior of native wildlife,” she said. If the resistance is too fierce, the bears go elsewhere. No one knows just how far the grizzly bear, protected as a threatened species, might journey from a bear-proof world. Could they roam their old haunts as far away as California and Colorado? “Maybe,” Mr. Jonkel said. “The wolf did.” '),(7,'Claudia Goldin Wins Nobel in Economics for Studying Women in the Work Force','Her research uncovered the reasons for gender gaps in labor force participation and earnings. She is the third woman to win the prize.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 13:31:08 +0000','The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded on Monday to Claudia Goldin, a Harvard professor, for advancing the world’s understanding of women’s progress in the work force. She is the third woman to have won the economics Nobel, which was first awarded in 1969, and the first one to be honored with it solo rather than sharing in the prize. Dr. Goldin, 77, is the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University. She has long been a trailblazer in the field — she was the first woman to be offered tenure in Harvard’s economics department, in 1989. The Nobel committee announced the award in Stockholm, praising Dr. Goldin for her research on female employment, which showed that employment among married women decreased in the 1800s, as the economy moved away from agriculture and toward industry. Women’s participation then increased in the 1900s, as the service sector began to expand as a part of the economy. Dr. Goldin has described the 1970s in particular as a “revolutionary” period in which women in the United States began to marry later, take strides in higher education, and make major progress in the labor market. Birth control pills became more easily available in those years, taking away what Dr. Goldin has called a “potent” reason for early marriage — and giving women more time to form identities outside of the home. Dr. Goldin has also illustrated how the process of closing the gender wage gap has been uneven over the course of history. Recently, progress in closing it has been halting: Today, women in the United States make a little over 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. In the past, gender wage gaps could be explained by education and occupation. But Dr. Goldin has shown that most of the earnings difference is now between men and women in the same jobs, the Nobel committee said. Notably, it kicks in after the birth of a woman’s first child. In a 15-year study of business school students at the University of Chicago, for instance, Goldin and her colleagues found in one paper that the gap in pay started to widen a year or two after a woman had her first baby. “Claudia Goldin’s discoveries have vast societal implications,” said Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the committee and professor of economics at the University of Gothenburg. Dr. Goldin said in an interview that she hoped people would take away from her work how important long-term changes are to understanding the labor market. “We see a residue of history around us,” she said, explaining that societal and family structures that women and men grow up in shape their behavior and economic outcomes. “We’re never going to have gender equality until we also have couple equity,” she said. While there has been “monumental progressive change, at the same time there are important differences” which often tie back to women doing more work in the home. Dr. Goldin has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. She often co-authors papers with her husband, Lawrence Katz, a fellow Harvard University economist. She was asleep when the call informing her of the prize came in — she had gotten up earlier to let the dog out but had gone back to bed. She said that she was “delighted.” Asked about what it meant for a woman to win the economics award on her own, Dr. Goldin said it marked a sort of “culmination” after years of “important changes” toward more gender diversity in the field. Claudia Olivetti of Dartmouth, a co-author of Dr. Goldin’s, said that Dr. Goldin’s work has “shaped much of the current research on women and labor markets.” She pointed out that it continues to today: Dr. Goldin has just released a new working paper on why women made such great advances in the 1970s, and why that progress has hit roadblocks in the years since. Dr. Goldin has also been an important mentor to many women entering the field of economics, she said. “Claudia has been a source of inspiration to many women in economics, generously sharing her experiences and demonstrating the possibilities of success in a mostly male-dominated world,” Dr. Olivetti wrote in an email. Leah Boustan, a professor at Princeton and once a student of Dr. Goldin’s, said that her work has had a “profound” influence on labor economics. “The first thing I thought about when Claudia won is how much her research is still inspiring current work,” she said, explaining that her students today are still digging into how marriage, contraception and labor market decisions have interacted over time. “There are so many threads that we as labor economists and economic historians can follow from Claudia’s work,” she said. In 2022, the award went to Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair, along with Douglas W. Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip H. Dybvig of Washington University in St. Louis. They won for work that has reshaped how the world understands the relationship between banks and financial crises. The economics prize was established in memory of Alfred Nobel by Sweden’s central bank and is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Here are this year’s winners.','https://www.nytimes.com/article/nobel-prizes-2023.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:11:37 +0000','Nobel Prize season is upon us once again. Every October, committees in Sweden and Norway name laureates in a variety of prizes in the sciences, literature and economics, as well as peace work. In total, six prizes were awarded. Laureates will receive their Nobel Prize medals and diplomas in Stockholm in December. Last year’s ceremony included 15 laureates from 2020 and 2021 who received their diplomas and medals in their home countries because of the coronavirus pandemic. Here is a quick guide to this year’s prizes. Six Nobel Prizes are awarded every year, each recognizing an individual’s or organization’s groundbreaking contribution in a specific field. Prizes are given for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, economic science, literature and peace work, which often draws the most attention because of the caliber of people and groups nominated. This year, there were 351 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel committee said. That’s the second highest number of candidates ever behind 2016, when 376 candidates were nominated. (Here’s how those nominations work.) Previous Nobel Peace Prize recipients include Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai (2014), President Barack Obama (2009), Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk (1993), the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso (1989) and Mother Teresa (1979). The award for physiology or medicine was awarded to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman on Oct. 2, for their discoveries that led to the development of effective vaccines against Covid-19. Read more about them here. On Tuesday, the award for physics was shared by three scientists — Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier — for their work on electrons. Read more about them here. The award for chemistry was awarded on Wednesday to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov for the discovery and development of quantum dots, nanoparticles so small that their size determines their properties. Read more about them here. On Thursday, the award for literature was awarded to the Norwegian author Jon Fosse “for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable.” Read more about him here. The award for peace work was awarded on Friday to Narges Mohammadi, a jailed Iranian activist, “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” Read more about her here. On Monday, the award for economic science was awarded to Claudia Goldin, a Harvard professor, for research that uncovered the reasons for differences in labor force participation and earnings for women. She is the third woman to win the economics Nobel. Read more about her here.  Nobel Prize laureates will receive a Nobel Prize diploma, a Nobel Prize medal and a document detailing the Nobel Prize amount, which this year is 11 million Swedish krona, or about $989,000 in current exchange rates.

As natural disasters become more common, school districts are grappling with how to adapt.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/schools-climate-change-buildings.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:00:52 +0000','When Hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle in 2018, Calhoun County schools were ravaged. Winds of 160 miles per hour destroyed an elementary school and ripped high-school bleachers from the ground.  “It was complete devastation,” said Darryl Taylor Jr., superintendent of the district. “It was like a nuclear bomb had gone off.” The Calhoun schools are still trying to rebuild what they lost five years ago. A new elementary school is not yet finished, and some students are still in temporary classrooms. The process of assessing the damage for insurance, along with the pandemic, has been arduous. “It was long and slow,” Mr. Taylor said. As climate disasters become more commonplace, school districts are learning that a strong storm can put learning in a state of disarray. In New York, a driving rain recently flooded the city, with water seeping into more than 300 schools. Cafeterias and kitchens were unusable; students’ 45-minute commutes turned into two hours; one school was temporarily evacuated. The soaking followed a summer marked by record heat and wildfires. The question for schools around the country remains how, and if, they can prepare their facilities for climate change — and other natural calamities, like the coronavirus pandemic. Money is one issue; bureaucracy is another. At the beginning of the academic year, many schools, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, had to close or dismiss students early because of sweltering heat. Many districts have aging schools that are not equipped to handle air-conditioning.  Heat waves are lasting longer and beginning earlier, said Jonathan T. Overpeck, dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. “Pretty much anywhere in the United States you’re going to have to be more careful about this and perhaps change how we run our schools in order to accommodate climate change,” Dr. Overpeck said.  But in many states, not enough money is being invested to make the necessary adjustments, he added. “People in some states are going to be hammered by climate change because their political leaders are unwilling to admit there’s a problem,” Dr. Overpeck said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Education are key sources of funding for K-12 districts that are recovering from natural disasters. A 2022 study from the United States Government Accountability Office found that 840 public school districts, including 39 of the 100 largest school districts in the country, received grants from at least one of the agencies between 2017 and 2019 following natural disasters.  The districts had a higher proportion of children from socially vulnerable populations, like students who are low income, disabled or a racial minority. These communities, the G.A.O. report said, can experience more negative outcomes from natural disasters. Part of the problem is that they often have limited insurance coverage. “Districts can’t always afford private insurance, which may have facilitated a more rapid recovery,” said Jacqueline M. Nowicki, director of K-12 education issues at the G.A.O. Even when there is insurance money, Ms. Nowicki said, it often does not cover the actual cost of the rebuild. Financial issues are compounded because many families move away after a natural disaster, which reduces funding to the district if the trend continues for several fiscal years. Costs also tick up. School districts have to provide more mental health support to students and teachers in the traumatic aftermath of a natural disaster — and keep them safe, too. The first two days back to learning for Calhoun County schools were difficult, said Mr. Taylor, the superintendent.  “Mainly, we needed to let them talk and debrief,” he said. “That following Monday, we picked up with instruction and moved on and finished a successful year as far as the academics were concerned.” But the loss of an elementary school forced the district to reconfigure their schools. With about 2,200 students in the district, some 600 students had to be assigned a new place to learn. Portable schools were set up, with meals brought in daily from other locations. The new elementary is expected to be finished next year. The Covid-19 pandemic delayed progress of the school, Mr. Taylor said, because of global supply chain issues. On top of that, Calhoun, which is in a rural area, had to find contractors from other locations to do such a large project. Those workers were in high demand, which also made the job more expensive. The new elementary school will have a cafeteria that is hardened to be used as a shelter or evacuation spot. It will also have bulletproof glass for security, another new educational imperative. “You build a school building, an entire facility, that’s a 50-year facility,” Mr. Taylor said. “You try to plan for some things down the road.” '),(10,'Belgian Preserve Melds Farming and Conservation, and Fights Extreme Weather','Can Europe fight the effects of extreme weather while producing enough affordable food? A model combining conservation with agriculture may offer a solution.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/europe/belgium-nature-preserve-eu-farm-policy.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 09:00:48 +0000','With cows grazing in a vast meadow surrounded by wire fencing, and with farmers checking to see how their livestock were faring under a scorching sun, it looked like a classic pastoral scene set on what was surely land dedicated to agriculture. But the cows and the farmers were actually guests in a nature preserve, one where both were welcome — with some stringent restrictions. As Europe looks for ways to balance what can be the competing demands of limiting the effects of extreme weather with producing enough affordable food, the Doode Bemde nature preserve, its supporters say, shows an innovative way to work toward achieving both goals. The idea for this preserve, set in an unassuming corner of Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, was dreamed up in the 1980s by a group of idealistic conservationists who came to the local village of Neerijse with a daunting task: convincing farmers to sell their land, which provided both their income and their sense of identity. The farmers’ initial reaction was “not good,” said Piet De Becker, one of those conservationists. “If you say, ‘Give me your land,’ they become angry.” Expecting such resistance, the conservationists were ready with the idea of a hybrid approach. If the farmers would agree to sell their land, they would be allowed to use the nature preserve, but with conditions: They could let their cows graze there. They could continue to farm specific plots. And they could cut grass to make hay — but only at specific times. They would also have to swear off pesticides and use only natural fertilizer. Gilbert Vanderveken, a fourth-generation farmer, was the first to sell in 1986, parting with 10 acres of his family’s land where they had farmed beets, chicory, wheat and corn. Mr. Vanderveken was joined by 11 other farmers over the ensuing years, and that land contributed to the creation of the 815-acre Doode Bemde preserve. Although the preserve was initially conceived as a project to foster the area’s biodiversity, it has come to play a crucial role in limiting the catastrophic floods that for centuries plagued the nearby city of Leuven and its roughly 100,000 people. When powerful rains ravaged Belgium and Germany in the summer of 2021, leaving at least 240 people dead, Leuven was spared. When the Dijle River overflowed its banks, it flooded into the nature preserve, which acted as a buffer zone and retained the water for three days, saving the city, through which the river runs, from a deluge. This victory, experts say, most likely would not have happened without the unique partnership between conservationists and farmers that made the preserve possible. “This nature preserve really has been a pioneer,” said Gert Verstraeten, a professor at KU Leuven, a university in the city, and an expert in water management. “People have been fighting over centuries against water, and now suddenly we have to acknowledge that if there really is a lot of water in the river system, you cannot stop it. So it’s better to give back the space to the rivers.” If more space elsewhere in Europe is going to be given back, then similar hybrid approaches might be one of the more effective models to follow, as the land adjoining rivers in rural areas is often occupied by the continent’s farms — and by politically powerful farmers, who might otherwise be reluctant to part with their plots. Agriculture has played an important role in the European Union since its creation, and the bloc provides farmers with billions of euros in subsidies every year to ensure that cheap food is available to all Europeans. But in recent years, in the face of an increasing number of extreme weather events tied to climate change, the priority has started shifting from producing food to embracing ambitious environmental policies, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions, restoring natural areas and limiting the use of pesticides. And it has become clear to policymakers that if the bloc wants to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, agriculture will have to change. In July, E.U. lawmakers approved a bill that would require member countries to restore large swaths of damaged natural habitats within their borders, angering farmers, who recently protested outside the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. While the Doode Bemde nature preserve offers a blueprint for reconciling agriculture and nature, it also reveals some of the limitations of such coexistence. Mr. De Becker, the conservationist, called the preserve “a win-win” model, but he conceded it came with drawbacks for the farmers. The preserve’s retention of water can alleviate the effects of droughts, but the cyclical flooding that now occurs makes much of it unsuitable for farming. And the agricultural work that does get done is less efficient than it once was, with farmers allowed access to only certain plots at certain times. “They get less profit per hour of work,” Mr. De Becker said. There had also been some hope that the partnership would win converts from more traditional farming practices. But of the 12 farmers, only one over the past 40 years has switched to organic farming. The others, including Mr. Vanderveken, continue farming outside the preserve using pesticides and nonorganic fertilizers. Mr. Vanderveken said that he did not think there was any “value added” by the E.U.’s green policies. But his two sons, who want to take over the family farm and over 300 cows he owns, have different opinions. “I am old school; they are new school,” he said. And he does not begrudge them their opinions. “We have to adapt,” he said. “Things move on.” Michel Frisque, the lone organic farmer, studied agricultural engineering in the 1970s and said he saw the negative effects that traditional farming had on his beloved nature. He rebelled against his traditionalist father, and he now farms apples and pears, and breeds cows and sheeps to be able to fertilize the orchards, making his operation entirely self-sufficient, he said. But Mr. Frisque does not blame his neighboring farmers or those across Europe for not following his path, which brings enough profit for him to make a living but is not, he said, an adequate way to feed the world’s population, at least if people “want to eat 500 grams of meat every day.” “We have 60 years of bad agriculture policy,” Mr. Frisque said. “But it’s important to say, that’s not the fault of the farmers. The consumer needs cheap food, and policy encouraged that.” In his view, what people eat, and how much, will need to be a part of any long-term solution. “You have to change your consumption habits a little bit,” he said. '),(11,'Parking in New York City Really Is Worse Than Ever','There are more cars but fewer available spots on the street. There are fewer garages — and exorbitant prices. For city drivers, it’s a growing headache.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/nyregion/nyc-parking-cars.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:12 +0000','After his shift at his limo company ended one night this year, Arben Elezi called his wife to tell her he would be home as soon as he found a parking spot. Hours later, she called him, frantic — he was still not back. He told her to look out the window of their Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Elezi had searched fruitlessly for a spot for so many hours that he had fallen asleep, double parked, out front. “It is a daily struggle to find parking,” Mr. Elezi said on a recent morning as he guarded his 2002 Mercedes against parking tickets during alternate side parking hours on Riverside Drive. “It takes away a lot of the quality of life.” New Yorkers have long groused about finding — and paying for — places to leave their cars. But now, inflation, the housing crisis and post-pandemic aftershocks have made what was already an urban blood sport nearly untenable. Drivers who find themselves priced out of expensive-as-rent garages are forced to hunt for parking spots increasingly crowded out by dumpsters, dining sheds, bike lanes and a glut of cars. This past fiscal year, the police issued 8.4 million tickets, one of the highest totals on record. No, you’re not imagining it: Parking in New York City is worse than ever. Topping the list of reasons is the sheer number of cars: There are over 2.2 million registered in New York City, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles, and many more that drive into the city each day from elsewhere. Many of them are now vying for the city’s roughly three million free parking spots. Competing for space by the curb are delivery hubs, bikes and dining sheds, which have chewed away at an estimated 8,000 of the city’s free street side parking spaces. There are now about 2,000 CitiBike bicycle rental docks, and counting. A study of the feasibility of installing rat-resistant garbage dumpsters by the Department of Sanitation showed such containers could claim another 150,000 spaces if implemented. There is also a peculiarly New York parking conundrum: So much of the city’s street parking is free (and meter parking is relatively cheap) that drivers park and just stay put, said Rachel Weinberger, the director of research strategy at Regional Plan Association; cars are not incentivized to budge. This month, the city will roll out higher meter prices, beginning in Manhattan, to induce turnover. “It helps people share better,” Ms. Weinberger, said. All this parking trouble comes at a time when there is an active effort to shrink the number of cars in New York because they contribute so much to climate change. Transit and environmental advocates argue that parking in the city — in garages and on public streets — should be expensive, partly as an incentive to keep people from driving in the first place. For those desperately in search of a place to leave their cars, the pain is felt citywide. But its apex is perennially car-stuffed Manhattan, where garage parking is the most expensive in the country — on average $441 per month — according to a recent study of nearly 40 big U.S. cities by FINN, a subscription car leasing company. (That’s about what you’d pay for 20 months of parking in Tulsa, Okla., the country’s cheapest, according to the findings.) The Upper West Side’s garages are the most expensive of all, it found, averaging $650 a month. On top of all that, with city real estate at a premium, many parking garages have vanished, scooped up by developers and converted into apartments. The scarcity appears to have driven up garage prices, drivers say; many even have wait-lists. In the Bronx, Abdoulaye Kabre, 45, an Instacart deliveryman, found the holy grail last year: a $200-per-month garage space right near his house. A friend was moving out of town and bequeathed her spot to him. Before that, he said, some nights when he couldn’t find a street spot, he slept in his car. “You don’t have a choice,” Mr. Kabre said. And there may soon be even fewer off-street options: Mayor Eric Adams recently introduced a plan to address the city’s affordable housing crisis that included easing a requirement that all new developments include parking. City Hall was quick to stress that parking is not under attack; rather, the use of curbs has evolved in recent years. “This is a vision where local businesses can access goods and welcome customers, where those who need to park cars can do so, and where the majority of New Yorkers and vast majority of Manhattanites who do not own personal cars can take advantage of the largest public bike share and the best public transit system in the nation,” said a spokesman for the mayor’s office, Charles Kretchmer Lutvak. Every so often, Dutch Benendez, 56, who said he is a disabled veteran and works as a street vendor, drives his cherry red Chevrolet HHR into garages near where he lives on West 85th Street. “I’ll pretend I’m looking for a spot just to see what the prices are,” he says. He inevitably drives right back out. On West 90th Street at a garage run by SP Plus Corporation, for example, parking a midsize car costs $844.77 a month — with tax, that’s $1,000 — about half of Mr. Benendez’s monthly earnings, he said. Hunting for spots, or waiting out alternate side parking — when drivers must move their cars to make way for street cleaners or risk a ticket — has frequently made him late for work, he said. Often, he can only find parking 30 blocks away from his home. “Sometimes I take the bus home from where I’ve found a spot,” Mr. Benendez said. This past year, the New York State Senate floated a proposal for residential parking permits in New York City, a plan that would essentially set aside certain parking spots for people who live in the neighborhood. It is a perennial topic of discussion that may gain more traction as congestion pricing — charging steep fees to commuters driving into certain parts of the city — becomes a reality. That’s because some fear that commuters will park on streets outside of the congestion zones, gobbling up more of a precious resource. “Anybody can park for free on our New York City streets,” said Renee Baruch, a retired corporate lawyer who started a lobbying group, NYC Resident Parking, to push for the permits. “Which is bizarre.” Some New Yorkers, like Malcolm Fox, 58, have done the math and figured that getting a $65 alternate side parking ticket every so often is far cheaper than garaging a car where he lives on the Upper West Side. Balancing life and parking means Mr. Fox finds about two orange slips under his windshield a month, he said, when he doesn’t have time to move his BMW for the street sweeper. “I take it all in my stride, because it’s cheap to park in New York for just 120 or so dollars,” Mr. Fox said. “It’s an easy choice to make.” That calculus may be why the police wrote a flurry of parking tickets this past fiscal year, summonses that could total over $724 million, according to an analysis of Department of Finance data by the New York City Comptroller’s office. But not everyone is paying up: In 2021, the total amount of money in outstanding parking tickets increased by one-third — drivers owe a total of $911 million — according to data from the Comptroller’s annual report; the next year it rose by more than 20 percent, to $1.1 billion. The number of new fines increased by 15 percent each year of those years, the report said. In June, Lincoln Restler, a New York City councilman and Democrat from Brooklyn, introduced legislation that ratchets up the penalty for each subsequent ticket; more than three strikes a year could result in a tow. The councilman does not have a car, he said. “But I am sympathetic to everybody who struggles with it.” '),(12,'Vaults, Ducts, Kitchens: Everything Must Go When a Company Moves Out','As companies reduce their office footprint to accommodate remote work, they are turning to decommissioning teams to clear out furniture, fixtures and equipment.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/office-space-vacancy-cleaning.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:00:34 +0000','Wayne Horne’s job comes with many challenges. This time, the problem was a generator that was too large to fit through its existing vent. Mr. Horne, the director of decommissioning at the real estate firm CBRE, was helping a client vacate a manufacturing plant in New Jersey. In addition to the furniture, fixtures and equipment, the tenant had installed a very large generator to back up its operations. But the building has been sold and planned for conversion to residential housing. The new owner does not want the generator, which is encapsulated by four walls. Removal will be complicated. “If it were sitting outside, its value would be around $250,000, but if we take it apart and sell it for scrap, then ‘poof’ that value just went away,” Mr. Horne said. His solution: take down a wall, remove the generator, then rebuild the wall at a cost of nearly $100,000. Welcome to the world of decommissioning offices, the often expensive and time-consuming undertaking of cleaning out a space when a tenant decides to leave. The process has grown in importance as office vacancies continue to increase. Office vacancy rates nationwide reached a record high of 16.4 percent in the three months that ended in June, exceeding the peak of 16.3 percent reached in the first quarter of 2010, during the financial crisis, according to the real estate firm Colliers. In addition, the amount of U.S. sublease space available rose in the second quarter of 2023 to 259 million square feet, an increase of five million square feet from the previous quarter. Although increased vacancies may be the result of several factors, including the often-cited “flight to quality” in office space, the jump in remote work is “the key driver of falling office space usage,” said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who studies work-from-home trends. In a survey of office workers, Professor Bloom and other researchers found that 57 percent of respondents were working in an office or on-site full time at the end of August, and the rest were fully remote or had a hybrid arrangement. “Our operating model now allows more people to work from home,” said Adam Plake, an associate vice president at DirecTV, who is working with CBRE to relinquish two of five office buildings in El Segundo, Calif. “Like other companies, we are constantly evaluating how we can tighten our belts and consolidate our space.” Leases typically delineate a tenant’s obligations when moving out. Traditionally, contract provisions are fairly basic. Before keys — whether electronic or physical — are returned to the landlord, furniture, fixtures and equipment must be cleared out, the space left “broom swept” or “broom clean,” and ultimately returned to the same state as first occupied. But straightforward lease provisions do not tell the whole story. Large heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems for old computer rooms must be dismantled. Abandoned vaults must be removed. And staircases, and even fully equipped kitchens, sometimes must go if commercial tenants hope to recover their security deposit. The cost of removal can be substantial. Tenants can recoup at least some value, often by selling some fixtures in the secondary market, but the expense is often unanticipated. Rarely are those expenses factored into the lease at the outset. Tenants “look at the costs going in, but underestimate or ignore the cost of removing equipment” when moving out, said Jay A. Neveloff, a partner at the law firm Kramer Levin in New York. Leases of 10 years or more are common in commercial real estate, but any equipment installed a decade ago becomes “functionally obsolete,” said Jeff Eckert, a managing director at the real estate firm JLL, which also helps clients with decommissioning. Commercial building owners, in particular, may focus on the ceiling’s ecosystem, he said. Cables and ductwork are most likely outdated; lighting has improved over the past decade to be more environmentally sound, and even ceiling tiles have been upgraded in terms of aesthetics and acoustics. Removing what were considered improvements a decade ago is necessary to create a “white box,” or shell, Mr. Eckert said, for prospective tenants to assess the space. At DirecTV, for example, planning began more than a year before the company was set to vacate a Denver site because the lease provisions required the space to be returned as it was when originally leased. But the office included not only a call center and administrative offices, but also a data center that incorporated complicated cables and industrial cooling systems. Removing those would entail hiring engineers. Sometimes tenants have installed staircases to connect floors. Even those may need to be removed, which sounds herculean, but if it doesn’t affect the structure of the space, it is a relatively simple process, Mr. Horne said. And then there is the signage outside a building. Affixed signs can easily be removed, but when the facade is granite or another higher-end material, the process is more complicated. Stone, for example, must be repaired and then cleaned to match the unadorned surface. When the tenant’s corporate name is carved into the building, the repair often involves replacement. Even then, “it won’t match exactly,” Mr. Horne said. “And those situations are the bane of my existence.” As with fashion, office design changes over time. Few people want the large mahogany tables that were once a fixture in board rooms. Landlines are relics. Jewelers and banks may need to contend with the removal of large vaults. Even kitchens have waned in popularity. Landlords now often require tenants to remove them, especially if the building owner plans to divide the footprint into smaller spaces. Bigger companies may retain them, but Mr. Horne predicts that “they’re a thing of the past.” In general, decommissioning costs in a metropolitan area can exceed those in suburban or rural areas. But removal costs may be offset if the vacating tenant is able to sell some of the furniture or fixtures in the secondary market. Task chairs remain popular and can easily find a home with employees, nonprofit groups or in the resale market. Disposing of furniture through recycling or donation can be as expensive as throwing it out in landfill, Mr. Horne said. Since CBRE began tracking the disposals done for clients last October, approximately 85 percent were diverted from landfill. When costs are very high, “a tenant’s obligations to remove items are only as good as their security deposit or letter of credit” used when entering into the lease, Mr. Neveloff said. In other words, a tenant may be willing to walk away from the security deposit if the decommissioning costs are prohibitive. The issues are rarely resolved by lawsuit, he added, because litigation typically costs more than having the installation removed. Tenants in bankruptcy often leave without fulfilling their obligations, resorting instead to “jingle mail,” a practice that, in the days before electronic entry, involved sending keys back to the landlord in an envelope, said Steven A. Carvell, a professor at the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business. The decommissioning process does have some lighter moments. Mr. Horne, for example, needed to remove a British double-decker bus from an architect’s office in Scottsdale, Ariz. A wall was taken down and the bus towed out, but the prior owners found a buyer for the bus in Nashville. (Mr. Horne said the bus was stored in a warehouse in the Memphis area). Will Powell, who owns a commercial interior design business in Nashville and sometimes works with clients to empty out offices, says strange items are often left behind. One of the most surprising was a full set of golf clubs. After searching unsuccessfully to find the person who left the clubs behind, he said, two crew members resorted to a time-honored approach to determine who would take them home. “They settled ownership with ‘rock-paper-scissors.’” '),(13,'Israel Must Unite to Meet This Threat','The nation acted as if it had the luxury of a vicious internal fight.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/opinion/international-world/israel-hamas-attack.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 03:45:16 +0000','Saturday will be remembered as one of the most devastating days in Israel’s history. The events were all too reminiscent of the attacks 50 years ago last week, on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. That day, in October 1973, Israel was attacked by a coordinated Arab coalition triggering a brutal, three-week war. The country survived only because of the huge sacrifice of its young men and women. It traumatized an entire generation of Israelis and changed the nation profoundly. Saturday was our 1973. The videos circulating of Israelis — women, children, older people — taken hostage, defenseless, will haunt us for the rest of our lives. The images are anathema not only to the basic Israeli ethos of self-defense but also to the country’s raison d’être as a safe haven for Jews. It shakes us to the core, but we do not have the luxury to dwell in the shock. We don’t have the time to digest the horrors. The Israel Defense Forces need to find the strength to regroup immediately and, once it has contained the situation within Israel’s borders, recalibrate and retaliate in a way that holds Hamas and its allies accountable and has a strategic logic, too. Our political leadership as well must re-examine the path it has charted and significantly change course. These tragic events have one protagonist: Hamas. But there are two major Israeli blind spots that prevented us from recognizing and forestalling what we should have seen. The first is a policy of trying to appease the enemy, in the hopes that Hamas would eventually grow out of its jihadist origin. Instead, it was Hamas’s military wing that grew — from a small organization to a powerful army. Our second blind spot was letting our internal political differences consume us, distracting us from external threats and dividing both our society and, critically, the army. In four years, Israel dedicated three military operations in Gaza to fighting Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small Iranian proxy organization. Hamas, the ruling party of Gaza, which operates an army with tens of thousands of missiles and elite commando units, had been largely left to its own devices since the Guardian of the Walls operation in 2021. We paid the price of war — as did civilians in Gaza — for zero strategic gain. Why? Because Palestinian Islamic Jihad was the easier target. Israel wanted to avoid a big war in Gaza, and we got a slaughter in Israel. Meanwhile, Hamas manipulated its way to this moment. It secured de facto immunity from Israel’s military force and got Qatari money every month for basic needs to help ensure that the population didn’t revolt. Politicians and military officers alike have spent the past two years leading the public to believe that Hamas was deterred, that it was not interested in a full-on escalation and was internalizing its role as the legitimate government of Gaza. Now many in Israel are asking, understandably, how did one of the best intelligence operations in the world fail to see the signs? One answer is that we tend to ignore details according to our preconception — which in this case was a misconception about what Hamas is and what its intentions really are. But this is just part of the story. In the past five years, as Israel dissolved government after government and held divided election after divided election, and even more so in the past year since Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected prime minister, the nation has been busy tearing itself apart from within. The Jewish state seems to have forgotten its second role in the world, as a place that embodies the idea of Jewish solidarity. Israelis instead found themselves engaged in an all-out war — not against terrorists but against themselves. Over the past nearly 40 weeks, as the battle over the judiciary overhaul surfaced, violently, old questions of identity and religious affiliation, as well as ethnicity, class and privilege, shook the populace. Is Israel more Jewish or more democratic? Many in Israel experienced real anxiety: The judiciary change, presented by the most right-wing government in the country’s history, seemed to threaten the liberal nature of their beloved country. They felt that they were fighting for the soul of the nation and that in this fight, all bets were off and nothing was sacred — including the once-untouchable idea of shirking reserve duty in the army. Despite the turmoil in the streets, the ruling coalition refused to accept the fact that with a slim majority, it could not enforce such big changes without consensus, plowing ahead with ever more anxiety-inducing policies day by day. As a nation, Israelis acted as if we could afford the luxury of a vicious internal fight, the kind in which your political rival becomes your enemy. We let animosity, demagogy and the poisonous discourse of social media take over our society, rip apart the only Jewish army in the world. This is our tragedy. And it carries a lesson for other polarized democracies: There is someone out there waiting to gain from your self-made weakness. This someone is your enemy. If there can be one conciliation after this darkest of days, it will be Israel returning to its senses, ending the political crisis and forming a unity government. There are many hard decisions that await us after the funerals, chief among them how to bring back home the young children and many others taken hostage by Hamas’s terrorists. The acts of deep solidarity that we witnessed in the past day remind us of our true nature, beneath the layers of political differences and old resentments. So many have opened their homes to families fleeing the horrors in the south, lined up for hours to donate food, drink, blood. And then there are heroes who risked — and in too many cases sacrificed — their lives, going from home to home, saving family after family. Saturday was a good day for the jihadists and their supporters around the world, for the people who celebrate the murder of civilians, who thrive on hatred and violence. Tomorrow Israelis will bury their dead. Israelis will think about the people taken captive, regroup and go out to win this battle. But the soul searching will eventually have to come.

I’ve always steered away from commenting on foreign affairs because I have so very many colleagues who know so very much more about them than I do. But I know you’re weighed down by the situation in the Middle East. I’m gonna sign off here so you can share your thoughts. Bret Stephens: Thanks for raising the subject, Gail. And since I’ve written a column about it, I promise to keep it brief so we can talk about marginally less depressing things, like the increasingly plausible prospect of a second Trump term. Israel occupies such a big place in the public imagination that people often forget what a small country it is. When an estimated 700 Israelis (a number that is sure to grow, out of a total population of a little over nine million) are killed in terrorist attacks, as they have been since Hamas’s rampage began Saturday morning, that’s the proportional equivalent of around 25,000 Americans. In other words, eight 9/11s. I know some of our readers have strong feelings about Israeli policies or despise Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But what we witnessed on Saturday was pure evil. Habitual critics of Israel should at least pause to mourn the hundreds of young Israelis murdered at a music festival, the mothers and young children kidnapped to Gaza to be used as human shields, the Israeli captives brutalized, the thousands of wounded and maimed civilians who were just going about their morning on sovereign Israeli territory. And the critics should also ask whether the version of Palestine embodied by Hamas, which tyrannizes its own people even as it terrorizes its neighbor, is one they can stomach. Gail: Horrific stories like the music festival massacre make it flat-out clear how this was an abomination that has to be decried around the globe, no matter what your particular position on Palestine is. Now, I will follow my own rule and dip back into domestic politics. Bret: OK, and I will have lots more to say about this in my regular column this week. I also know you’re raring to talk about those charming House Republicans who ended Kevin McCarthy’s speakership last week. But first I have to ask: How do you feel about Build-the-Wall-Biden? Gail: I knew you were going to head for the wall! Couple of thoughts here, the first being that the money was appropriated by Congress during the Trump administration for his favorite barrier and President Biden was right when he asked for it to be reallocated to a general migration-control program. Which, of course, didn’t happen. I still hate, hate, hate the wall and all it symbolizes. But also understand why Biden didn’t want to give Republicans ammunition to claim he wasn’t trying to control the immigration problem. Now, feel free to tell me that you differ …. Bret: It ought to be axiomatic that you can’t have a gate without a wall. If we want more legal immigration, which we both do, we need to do more to prevent illegal immigration. It’s also a shame Biden didn’t do this two years ago when he could have traded wall-building for something truly constructive, like citizenship for Dreamers and a higher annual ceiling for the number of political refugees allowed into the United States. Now he just looks desperate and reactive and late to address a crisis he kept trying to pretend wasn’t real. Not to mention the political gift this whole fiasco is to Donald Trump, who now has a slight lead over Biden in the polls. Aren’t you a wee bit nervous? Gail: Impossible not to be a wee bit nervous when Trump’s one of the options. But I still think when we really get into all the multitudinous criminal and civil trials, it’s going to be very hard for the middle-of-the-road, don’t-ask-me-yet voters to pick the Trump option. Bret: I wouldn’t get my hopes up on that front. For so many Americans, Trump’s indictments have gone from being the scandal- of the century to just so much white noise on cable TV, like all of Trump’s other scandals. The only thing millions of Americans care about is whether they are better off in 2023 than they were in 2019, the last full year under Trump that wasn’t affected by the pandemic. And the sad truth is: Many believe that they aren’t. Gail: I will refrain from veering off into a discussion of how the Trump tax cuts caused the deficit to surge. Or mentioning the latest jobs report, which was really good. Bret: Shame about the high gas prices, rising mortgage rates, urban decay, a border crisis and all the other stuff my liberal friends keep thinking is just some sort of American hypochondria. Gail: It’s settled — we disagree. Time for us to get on to those embattled House Republicans. Anybody in contention for speaker of the House you actually like? Bret: You’re asking me to pick my poison. I’d say Steve Scalise, the majority leader who once described himself as “David Duke without the baggage,” is still better than Jim Jordan, but that’s because almost everyone is better than Jim Jordan, the former wrestling coach. Republicans don’t have particularly good experiences with former wrestling coaches who become speakers of the House. Admit it: You’re sorta enjoying this G.O.P. meltdown, right? Gail: At the moment, absolutely. Once again, this is a Trump creation. He was the one who engineered the nomination of so many awful House candidates that the Republicans couldn’t get the usual post-presidential election surge in the out-party’s seats. They’re not even a majority if you subtract the total loons, like our friend Matt Gaetz. But I’m not looking forward to a government shutdown, and I doubt these guys will be able to get the votes together to avoid one next month. Bret: We are in agreement. All the clichés about lunatics running the asylum, letting the foxes in the henhouse, picking the wrong week to stop sniffing glue, and really futile and stupid gestures apply. A government shutdown will accomplish exactly nothing for Republicans except make them seem like the party of total dysfunction — which, of course, is what they are. Not exactly a winning political slogan. Gail: Can you make dysfunction a slogan? Maybe: Vote for This — Total Dys! Bret: Our colleague Michelle Goldberg got it right last week when she said that centrist Republicans would have been smart to team up with Democrats to elect a unity candidate as speaker, someone like Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican. But of course that would have meant putting country over party, a slogan that John McCain ran for president on but hardly exists today as a meaningful concept. Gail: You know, my first real covering-a-presidential-race was the one in 2000, and McCain was my focus. I followed him around on his early trips to New Hampshire. He’d drive to a town and talk to some small veterans’ gathering or student club or — anybody who’d ask him. And his obsession was campaign finance reform. It was pretty wonderful to watch up close. Later, he got a bill passed that improved the regulations. Can’t think of a current Republican candidate who is super-focused on driving out big-money donors. Bret: I thought McCain was wrong about campaign finance reform; he would often be the first to admit that he was wrong about a lot of stuff. But politics was more fun, more functional, more humane and more honorable when his way of doing business ruled Congress than it is with the current gang of ideological gangsters. Gail: So true. Bret: Speaking of our political malfunctions, our colleague Alex Kingsbury had a really thoughtful Opinion audio short talking about how violent Trump’s rhetoric has become. Trump had suggested that Gen. Mark Milley had behaved treasonously and said shoplifters deserved to be executed. One point Alex makes is that a second Trump term would very likely be much worse than the first. Do you agree or do you think it will be the same Spiro Agnew-Inspector Clouseau mash-up we had last time? Gail: You know, a basic rule of Trumpism is that he always gets worse. Alex’s piece is smart, and his prediction is deeply depressing. Bret: The scary scenario is that Trump 2.0 makes no concessions to the normal conservatives who populated the first administration: people like Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster and Scott Gottlieb. So imagine Stephen Miller as secretary of homeland security, Tucker Carlson as secretary of state, Sean Hannity as director of national intelligence and Vivek Ramaswamy as vice president. This could be an administration that would pull the United States out of NATO, defund Ukraine, invade Mexico and invite Vladimir Putin for skeet shooting at Camp David. Gail: As I’ve pointed out before, this is one reason people watch football. Bret: Just wait until Steve Bannon somehow becomes N.F.L. commissioner during the second Trump term. Gail: One last issue: I know you’re not in favor of bringing up global warming when it’s time to admire the leaves, but whenever the weather gets bad now, I worry that it’s a hint of more dire things to come. This winter, if it’s colder than usual I’ll be miserable because it’s … cold. But now I can’t really feel totally chipper if it’s warm, either. Bret: I really am concerned with the climate. But, hey, we may as well enjoy some nice fall weather while we still can. Gail: You totally win that thought. Look for the good moments whenever you can. Here at the end, you generally conclude with a poem or a nod to a great piece you read. Particularly eager to hear it this week. Bret: Did you know that one of Shakespeare’s sonnets touches on climate change? Here is another gem my dad had the good sense to make me memorize: '),(15,'In Nagorno-Karabakh, We Just Saw What the World Is About to Become','The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is a harbinger of global disorder.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/opinion/nagorno-karabakh-russia-turkey.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:22:26 +0000','The history of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended in the old manner of conflict resolution: siege, conquest, expulsion. After a 10-month blockade, Azerbaijan launched an attack on Sept. 19, claiming the enclave in a day and causing nearly the entire ethnic Armenian population to flee. Give war a chance, as the saying goes. For Armenians, a classic relic ethnic minority whose Christianity and peculiar alphabet date to the epic struggles between the Romans and the Parthians, it was another genocide. For the Azerbaijanis, Turkic in language and historically Shia Muslim, a great triumph. Yet despite appearances, the conflict is not a Samuel Huntington-style clash of civilizations. Instead, in its emboldening of traditional regional powers like Turkey, scrambling for geopolitical spoils after the retreat of superpowers, it’s a harbinger of the coming world disorder. Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region in the South Caucasus, is perennially contested. Ceded by Persia to Russia in the 19th century, it fell into dispute with the emergence of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan both claiming it. In 1921, Stalin attached the enclave to Azerbaijan, home to oil resources and a thriving intellectual culture. Yet the thin crust of Azeri modernist intelligentsia was eliminated in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s and replaced by corrupt functionaries overseen by the formidable K.G.B. general Heydar Aliyev. (His son, Ilham Aliyev, is the dynastic president of Azerbaijan.) In 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev’s dreams of achieving a more rational, humane Soviet Union emboldened Armenian intellectuals to start a tremendous popular movement for uniting the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh with mainland Armenia. This seemed deceptively easy: transfer a province from one Soviet republic to another. But the Armenian demands ran into protests in Azerbaijan that almost immediately turned violent. Gorbachev looked impotent in the face of disasters he had provoked. From there to the end of the superpower, it took just three years. In the chaotic aftermath of Soviet collapse, the Armenians undertook to defend Nagorno-Karabakh by force. Instead of poetic intellectuals, the wartime generation of Armenian leaders became militia commanders. They proved earthier and, soon, brazenly corrupt. Defending the country became their sole means of legitimacy, ruling out the concessions that peace would require. By 1994 the Armenians, mobilizing around the traumatic memories of genocide, succeeded in expelling scores of Azeris from the enclave. Last month, Azerbaijan got more than even. In that project, it had a powerful backer: Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a master of vertiginous visions, has already tried Islamic liberalism, joining Europe, leading the Arab revolts, challenging Israel and negotiating peace in Ukraine. He now has another dream: opening a geopolitical corridor from Europe through Central Asia, all the way to China. This is the “Zangezur corridor,” a 25-mile-long strip of land to be carved through Armenia as part of a peace deal imposed at gunpoint. Iran is not happy with Azerbaijan’s victory. As openly as the Iranians ever do, they’ve threatened to use force against any changes to the borders of Armenia. Iran, a millenniums-old civilization central to a whole continent, cannot tolerate being walled off behind a chain of Turkish dependencies. India, similarly, is on Armenia’s side and has been sending a regular supply of weapons. One spur for such support, no doubt, is Pakistan’s joining the Azeri-Turkish alliance. In the jargon of American lawyers, this opens a whole new can of worms. Then there’s Russia, whose absence from the denouement in Nagorno-Karabakh was striking. Even after the 1990s, Moscow still remained by far the biggest supplier of weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Their economies and societies, above all the elites and their corruption networks, were until very recently molded together. What we are seeing now, as both nations slip out of Russia’s orbit, might be the second round of Soviet collapse. Once again, Armenia started the shift. In spring 2018 a tremendously hopeful uprising, reminiscent of 1989 in Central Europe, forced the post-communist elites to surrender power. Vladimir Putin was visibly displeased to meet Nikol Pashinyan, the anticorruption journalist and street rebel elected Armenia’s premier by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Pashinyan admittedly had neither political team nor experience; he is learning statesmanship on the job, often at great expense to his nation. Yet he managed to significantly reduce corruption, helping to unlock the legendary entrepreneurship of Armenians. Amid all the grim news, the Armenian economy, led by the I.T. sector, is registering impressive growth. All that, to Moscow, is punishable. When in September 2020 Azerbaijan launched a massive offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh lasting 44 terrible days, Russia effectively allowed Azerbaijan and Turkey to nearly destroy its Armenian ally, under the pretext that Karabakh was outside the mutual defense treaty. At the cusp of Azeri victory, however, Mr. Putin personally brokered a cease-fire and ordered a crack force of his peacekeepers into the enclave. That brought nearly all the perimeter of the former Soviet Union into Russia’s sphere of influence. Rebellious Belarus, its dictator dependent on Russian support, was in hand; so too the war-torn Caucasus. The large and oil-rich Kazakhstan itself requested Russian peacekeepers during a bewildering bout of street violence in January 2022. Strangely, the elite Russian troops soon departed from Kazakhstan. A month later, the whole world realized that they had been dispatched to Ukraine, the last sizable piece of Mr. Putin’s post-Soviet gambit. And there his plan broke down. History has a habit of serving the same lessons with changed variables. In 1988, it was the dreamer Gorbachev stumbling over Nagorno-Karabakh that unwittingly shattered the world order. Today, Mr. Putin could become the second, much darker incarnation of the Kremlin aggrandizer going awry on all fronts. The consequences — from emboldening international aggression to reanimating the West under the banner of NATO — will be profound. As events in Nagorno-Karabakh show, the fragile post-Cold War order is giving way to something else entirely. The Caucasus might seem strange and distant. Yet it might prove the wedge that turns the fortunes of world order. Trieste, Smyrna, Sarajevo, Danzig and Crimea were all such places. Let us not have to relearn history at the cost of yet another ethnic cleansing. '),(16,'What We Can Do to Make the House Less Dysfunctional','We need to rethink party primaries — which give our politicians all the wrong incentives.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/opinion/american-politics-congress-reform.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:01:58 +0000','The disarray engulfing the House of Representatives has been unprecedented, yet somehow it has also felt inevitable. No sitting speaker has ever been removed before, but the process that brought about Representative Kevin McCarthy’s overthrow was the culmination of several related trends that have amounted to a repudiation of coalition-building in American politics. That process has been overdetermined in an era of partisan polarization and geographic sorting (Americans increasingly live in communities full of like-minded partisans), but that doesn’t mean we are powerless against it. The rules of our politics should be designed to counteract our worst vices, not to reinforce them. That means we particularly need to rethink party primaries — which give our politicians all the wrong incentives. The upheaval in the House is rooted in the dynamics of an era of deadlock. American politics isn’t just polarized but nearly tied, and it has been that way for much of the past 30 years. The average House majority since 1995 has been just over 30 seats. The average over the previous century was more than 80 seats. The current Congress and the previous one, with their incredibly slim House majorities (first Democratic and then Republican), are rare in historical perspective. Such narrow majorities empower the fringes of our politics. Only eight Republican members voted to remove their speaker, but when the majority’s margin is so small (and the minority party can be relied on to play its lock step part), a tiny tail can wag the dog. Razor-thin majorities are inherently unstable, yet neither party seems capable of broadening its appeal, and therefore its coalition. Mr. McCarthy’s ouster was also a function of the centralization of power in Congress. The toppling of the speaker might suggest that House leaders are too weak, but partisan dissatisfaction with Mr. McCarthy had to do with the effectively impossible expectations members now have of party leaders. The members who rebelled against him claimed to want “regular order” in the House, but they also insisted that legislative outcomes must conform to strict partisan goals. These are plainly contradictory demands: Regular order involves cross-partisan negotiation and bargaining, and so would result in legislative outcomes that are more durable but less ideologically satisfying. In the end, the rebels revealed their real priorities. They kicked out the speaker for passing a continuing resolution with Democratic votes, putting their weight behind the notion that party leaders must tightly control the House and prevent cross-partisan coalitions from forming. The Democrats’ unanimity in supporting the speaker’s removal evinced the same view. But perhaps above all, the tumult in the House is a function of deformed expectations of Congress itself. Members are increasingly pulled in different directions by the imperatives of legislative work and those of electoral politics. A legislature is an arena for negotiation, where differences are worked out through bargains. But our polarized political culture treats deals with the other party as betrayals of principle and failures of nerve. Traditionally, winning an election to Congress has meant winning a seat at the negotiating table, where you can represent the interests and priorities of your voters. Increasingly, it has come instead to mean winning a prominent platform for performative outrage, where you can articulate your voters’ frustrations with elite power, and show them that you are working to disrupt the uses of that power. These expectations coexist, sometimes within individual members. But they point in very different directions, because the latter view does not involve traditional legislative objectives, and so is not subject to the incentives that have generally facilitated Congress’s work. Instead, some members respond to the incentives of political theater, which is often at least as well served by legislative failure as success. This impulse is evident in both parties, though it is clearly most intense among a portion of congressional Republicans. Most members still have a more traditional view of their job, and most voters do too, and yet today’s most powerful electoral incentives nonetheless militate toward the more populist, performative view. That’s because electoral incentives for most members of the House now have to do with winning party primaries. This is not only because geographic sorting has made more seats safe in general elections, but also because the parties have grown institutionally weak, and so have little say over who runs under their banners. Whether justifiably or not, even established incumbents and swing-seat members often worry most about primary challenges, and therefore about voters who do not want them to give ground or compromise. This effectively means they find it politically dangerous to do the job Congress exists to do. This is a perverse misalignment of incentives. And it contributes to the dynamics that shaped the drama in the House, because it ultimately undermines the imperative for coalition-building. Our parties are deadlocked in part because neither really strives to significantly broaden its coalition — doing so would involve playing down some priorities that most energize primary voters. Power is centralized in Congress to avert unpredictable cross-partisan coalitions and more effectively stage-manage a partisan Kabuki theater. But more than anything, party primaries now leave both voters and members confused about the purpose of Congress, and so disable the institution. While there are some reforms of Congress’s procedures that could help it work better — like a budget process that did not culminate in needlessly dramatic crisis moments, and a committee system with more genuine legislative power — it is also increasingly clear that nominee-selection reforms are in order. Primaries did not create our polarized culture war. They have been widely used to select congressional candidates in most of the country for over a century, and since the 1970s they have also dominated presidential-candidate selection in both parties. But party primaries have come to interact with our embittered political culture in destructive ways. As Nick Troiano argues in a forthcoming book, primaries are bad for voters, bad for parties and bad for the country. We can’t go back to the pre-primary system in which party professionals deliberated about candidate selection. No politician wants to tell his or her most intensely devoted voters that they are the problem, and in any case that older approach had its own grave deficiencies. So reformers have to look for ways forward within the primary system. They should structure primary elections in ways that incentivize actual legislative work and draw into politics a type of officeseeker inclined to appeal to a broader range of voters and to build coalitions. Ranked-choice voting in primaries could be particularly promising. A ranked-choice election allows voters to select multiple candidates in order of preference, and then have their vote count on behalf of their second or third choice if their first or second choice is not among the top vote-getters. In most forms, it is essentially an automatic runoff. From the point of view of candidates, such a system creates a strong reason to be many voters’ second choice, as well as the first choice of some. That naturally invites a coalition-building mind-set and could do a better job of attracting candidates capable of broad appeal both on the campaign trail and in office. It would compel politicians to feel accountable to a broader swath of voters, even in safe districts where only the primary matters. This was the experience of the Virginia Republican Party, which turned to a ranked-choice process to select its gubernatorial nominee in 2021, and through it landed on a candidate, Glenn Youngkin, capable of winning in a purple state. Similar reforms at the primary stage could plausibly help both parties, though there is reason to think that Republicans would have more to gain from deploying them, because at this point they appear to suffer more from the tendency of primaries to yield candidates who turn off winnable but uncommitted voters in the general election and who have little interest in the jobs they are elected to perform. Republicans tend to be more staunchly opposed to such proposals, and to assume they would only benefit the left. The evidence so far does not support that assumption. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Kevin Kosar argued in a recent paper, Republicans have particularly strong reasons to consider such reforms — at least in primaries. Deploying ranked-choice methods in general elections could tend to further weaken the parties, which is not the right way to take on our broken political culture. The two parties as institutions are actually moderating forces, because each has an interest in making its tent as broad as possible. But ranked-choice primaries would strengthen the parties, by reinforcing their ability to nominate candidates with broad appeal and better aligning primary, general-election, and governing incentives Ranked-choice methods would be particularly valuable in congressional primaries because, as we have seen, Congress particularly suffers from the tendency of members to neglect coalition-building and deplore negotiation. The dysfunction of the national legislature is also the source from which most other constitutional dysfunctions now radiate. But if they prove effective, similar reforms might ultimately be of use in presidential primaries as well, and in primaries for state and local offices. There is no silver bullet for what ails our politics. And ideas like these should be pursued as experiments, state by state. There is always a risk that they could make things worse. But the risks we run by doing nothing are plainly mounting.

The fictional loan goes to the heart of one of the most vexing questions surrounding Mr. Santos since he was elected to Congress last year: How did a man of seemingly modest means suddenly accrue enough money to lend his campaign a half-million dollars? The answer, it turns out, is simple: He did not. And that fact could have serious ramifications for his case. In May, Mr. Santos, a New York Republican, was charged with 13 felonies in three unrelated financial schemes, to which he has pleaded not guilty. On Thursday, his campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy related to her oversight of Mr. Santos’s finances. It is clear that prosecutors see a link between Ms. Marks’s criminal activity and Mr. Santos. The same team of U.S. attorneys handled their cases; the proceedings share the same court docket number and were overseen by the same judge, Joanna Seybert. Mr. Santos has not been charged with falsifying the loan or with other campaign finance violations, and Ms. Marks’s lawyer has said that she is not cooperating with prosecutors. But Mr. Santos’s proximity to the criminal activity admitted by Ms. Marks would seem to leave him vulnerable to additional charges. In Ms. Marks’s charging papers, prosecutors laid out a scheme centered on Mr. Santos’s desire to qualify for a Republican campaign committee program that offered candidates logistical, political and financial support. In order to be considered, candidates needed to raise $250,000 in donations in a single quarter. In court papers filed on Thursday against Ms. Marks, prosecutors portrayed Mr. Santos, who was described as “co-conspirator #1,” as “lost and desperate” at the end of 2021. Having failed to raise the necessary $250,000 by the end of 2021, they say he resorted to a familiar strategy: He bent the truth. Citing text messages and emails, prosecutors said that Mr. Santos and Ms. Marks agreed to file reports that said the campaign had raised the money it needed to after all, by including fake contributions from relatives who had never actually donated. “These are the donations we spoke about last night before we went to sleep,” reads a text from Mr. Santos to Ms. Marks that included a list of relatives and donation amounts. Three days later, Ms. Marks texted Mr. Santos, court records say, seeking the “list of donors — your family.” Mr. Santos sent it along once more, this time with the family members’ addresses and occupations. The false donations, over $50,000 in all, allowed Mr. Santos to be selected for the program. Three months later, in March 2022, prosecutors say that Mr. Santos’s campaign sought additional support of the national party committee and again turned to lies to make their case. In a presentation the Santos campaign made to the national party, court records say, the campaign reported that a “key factor” of Mr. Santos’s success was the “[p]ersonal and political capital that will allow for a fully funded operation.” Here, prosecutors say, is where the $500,000 loan came in. In its April 2022 quarterly report, Mr. Santos’s campaign filings said that he lent the campaign half a million dollars that prosecutors said was never deposited and that Ms. Marks acknowledged last week was a fiction. Even so, it bolstered his image as a wealthy, self-funding candidate and helped the campaign appear more robust and well-funded than it was — dissuading would-be primary challengers. The loan had another potential benefit. As a member of Congress running for re-election, Mr. Santos would have been able to continue to fund-raise. If he raised enough, he could “repay” himself the fictional loan — potentially pocketing $500,000 in contributions. The loans Mr. Santos made to his campaign have long drawn scrutiny. In his initial House run in 2020, he reported having lent himself $80,000, though his financial disclosure said his annual salary was just $55,000, and he had no savings account. But in 2022, he reported a startling turn in fortune. He claimed to have made $750,000 in salary plus more than a million dollars each year in dividends from his company, the Devolder Organization — even though the company had no visible footprint or website. Nathan Reilly, a former prosecutor with the Eastern District of New York’s public integrity section, said that if Mr. Santos is not able or willing to negotiate a plea, prosecutors might bring additional charges. Mr. Santos has remained quiet about Ms. Marks’s conviction. His lawyer, Joseph Murray, declined to answer reporters’ questions in Central Islip on Thursday. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Santos used social media to thank his supporters while striking a defiant tone. “I’ve never run from tough questions, and I never intend to do so,” he said. “I dare anyone to find an elected who engages with the people more than I do.” He is due back in court on Oct. 27. '),(19,'Does the Supreme Court’s Cherry-Picking Inject Politics Into Judging?','By choosing among and sometimes writing the questions the court agrees to answer, recent studies say, the justices have distorted the judicial process.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/supreme-court-cases.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:02:16 +0000','We say that the Supreme Court decides cases, but that is not correct. It picks isolated questions to answer, often choosing among ones proposed by the parties or writing ones of its own. That practice adds a disturbing element of politics to the judicial process, said Benjamin B. Johnson, a law professor at the University of Florida and the author of three recent papers on the subject. “They are no longer doing what a court does, which is deciding cases,” he said. “They’re now doing what a legislature does, which is answering discrete policy questions.” Consider a few examples. When the court agreed to hear one of this term’s most important cases, it rejected a modest question proposed by the plaintiffs and said it would only consider one that asked it to overrule an important precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The same thing happened in the Dobbs case, which eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. When the court granted review, it picked only the broadest of the three proposed questions, one that led it to overrule Roe v. Wade. “Even though the court had alternative pathways to resolve the case without inviting a firestorm of controversy,” Professor Johnson wrote in the Alabama Law Review, “the justices intentionally eliminated those alternatives from their review.” In the recent case of a Christian web designer who challenged a Colorado law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation, the court accepted only part of one of her two proposed questions. The court said it would not consider whether the law was at odds with her right to free exercise of her religion and would treat the case solely a free-speech challenge. And when the court agreed to hear two big cases on the First Amendment and social media last month, it did not adopt the questions proposed by any of the parties. It looked instead to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Biden administration, choosing two of its four questions. This sort of cherry-picking and revision, Professor Johnson said, is on the rise. “What was once a relatively rare occurrence now makes up between a tenth and a quarter of the docket,” he said. The practice is problematic, he added. “This arrangement may serve the court’s institutional interests,” he wrote in the Columbia Law Review, “but it also pulls the court into politics.” Data compiled by Professor Johnson from the two decades ending in 2020 seems to back that up. When the court added or subtracted questions, he found, the case was more likely to attract friend-of-the-court briefs and to result in 5-to-4 splits. A century ago, in 1925, Chief Justice William Howard Taft persuaded Congress to cut back on the kinds of cases the Supreme Court had to hear, allowing the court to choose for itself which ones it would decide. That itself was an extraordinary move. Giving the justices almost total discretion over their docket helped to transform and empower it. But the 1925 law did not authorize the justices to take the further step of picking the questions they would answer. “This is clear both from the statutory language and the justices’ own testimony in favor of the bill,” Professor Johnson wrote. Indeed, Chief Justice Taft had assured lawmakers that in federal cases the “power of review extends to the whole case and every question presented in it.” Still, in later decisions and then in the court’s own rules, the justices said they would consider only discrete questions. That was so, Professor Johnson wrote, “even though Congress mandated — and the justices promised — review of the entire case.” It is one thing to allow the Supreme Court to decide which cases to hear and another to let it choose to answer the questions proposed in the petition seeking review. But it is a third thing for the justices to choose among those questions. And it is yet another thing for them to write their own questions. But the court has drafted its own questions in any number of landmark cases, including ones on the right to counsel, the 2000 presidential election, campaign finance, same-sex marriage, class actions, recess appointments and immigration. At the same time, the Supreme Court has had little patience with lower courts that try something similar. Three years ago, for instance, the justices chastised a federal appeals court for revising the questions before it, saying that it ran afoul of “the principle of party presentation.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, quoting an earlier decision, explained that “we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.” '),(20,'Yeats and Beckett, Guarding the Irish Coast From Drug Runners','The Irish Navy’s small fleet of warships may be named for celebrated poets and playwrights, but its mission is anything but whimsical, as a record seizure of cocaine from a cargo ship showed.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/europe/irish-navy-ships-poets-yeats.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 13:00:29 +0000','Ireland is proud of its celebrated writers, particularly W.B. Yeats, the vaunted poet who grew up partly in Sligo, a rugged, rural West Coast county that treasures its enduring role as Yeats Country. You can stop in at WB’s Coffee House on Stephen Street in Sligo town or the nearby Yeats Society for a poetry reading. You can hike the Yeats Trail and stop by the poet’s modest grave at Drumcliffe Church. So it was notable one morning last month when The Irish Times reported the biggest drug raid in Irish history had been carried out by — who else? — William Butler Yeats. Not the poet himself, of course, who died in 1939, but his namesake, a 300-foot-long warship. It was a reminder that the Irish Navy, to the delight of some and the scorn of others, has been naming ships in its small fleet after Irish writers for nearly a decade. The renewed attention came on Sept. 26, when a cargo ship from South America carrying more than two tons of cocaine appeared, as the poet once wrote, on “the white breast of the dim sea.” Warning shots from the Yeats helped stop the cargo ship, allowing Army Rangers to board and pull off a dramatic seizure of drugs worth more than $160 million. While the authorities hailed the raid as a sign of their coastal patrol prowess, some questioned whether a tiny navy with ships named after Irish poets and writers can adequately stop drug running along the coast. (“Gonna Need Bigger and More Boats,” The Irish Echo said in an editorial.) It has not helped matters that the navy’s ranks have thinned to the point that it can now support patrols by only two major vessels: the Yeats and the Samuel Beckett, named after the absurdist dramatist who penned “Waiting for Godot.” The James Joyce and the George Bernard Shaw were recently taken out of action amid personnel shortages that have left the ranks thinner than any point since the 1970s, said Eugene Ryan, a former Irish Navy commander. “The drug dealers know this,” he said. When he retired in 2012, he said, the navy had 1,200 personnel and eight operational ships. The navy, which patrols Irish waters with help from the country’s Air Corps and other enforcement agencies, reports it now has 755 personnel and two operational ships at any given time, with plans to acquire two more. Mr. Ryan, who helped lead two large drug seizures off the Irish coast in 2007 and 2008, both with multiple naval vessels, said it was risky to have the Yeats handle the raid without backup. And as for the ship’s name, he said, “when they began naming vessels after literary people like Yeats and Beckett, we didn’t like it at all.” He said the navy’s previous practice of using women’s names from mythology and folklore was “a seamen’s tradition that we were proud of.” Defense officials announced the new approach in 2014 to “facilitate greater recognition” for the navy. When the Irish leader Enda Kenny christened the Samuel Beckett in 2014, he noted the “delicious irony” in naming it for a man who famously abhorred public attention. The criticism was immediate. The Irish filmmaker and writer Neil Jordan complained that it was inappropriate to associate artists — many of them pacifists — with ships equipped with cannons and heavy machine guns. The four ships named for writers now make up the bulk of the navy’s large vessels. They are best known for humanitarian deployments, including the response to the European migrant crisis in the Mediterranean Sea and the coronavirus pandemic, when the Beckett was turned into a mobile testing center. For many, the names resonate, perhaps because so many Irish writers were inspired by the ocean. Yeats had his “mackerel-crowded seas.” In “Ulysses,” Joyce took a different tack, writing of the “snotgreen sea,” in contrast to the “wine-dark sea” of Homer’s “Odyssey.” Eve Patten, a professor of Irish Literature at Trinity College Dublin, said that Shaw, Beckett, Joyce and Yeats “were all voyagers themselves and sailed away from Ireland as soon as they could.” Beckett was a great sea swimmer whose father threw him into the frigid waters off the Dublin coast as a child, she noted, and “Ulysses” is full of references to sailors and ships. “But what about the women?” Professor Patten said. “We have plenty of real-life Irish women writers to choose from. Where is the Lady Augusta Gregory, the Edna O’Brien, or the Maeve Binchy? Or perhaps the Sally Rooney?” The Irish writer Colm Tóibín said he was struck by the image of drug dealers being pursued by a vessel named for the poet who wrote “Sailing to Byzantium.” “There’s something lovely about the grandeur of Yeats’s name on a ship,” Mr. Tóibín said. “It’s the sort of joke Joyce would have loved, the idea of having a little piece of tin named after him.” He mused that if the navy vessels took on the personas of their writers or the characteristics of their works, then smugglers should most fear the one named for the quiet minimalist Samuel Beckett. “It would be silent,” he said, “and would be upon you before you knew it was there.” As for George Bernard Shaw, who wrote plays that could exceed three hours, Mr. Tóibín said, a drug runner might decide “anything but a Shaw play” and simply surrender. '),(21,'Xi-Schumer Meeting Raises Hopes of Smoother U.S.-China Relations','Mr. Xi said there were “1,000 reasons” to make the relationship work. Earlier, the Senate majority leader had criticized Beijing for its response to the attack by Hamas in Israel.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/asia/xi-schumer-meeting-china-us.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:23:52 +0000','China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, met with Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, in Beijing on Monday and expressed hopes of “peaceful coexistence” between China and the United States, even as escalating violence in the Middle East threatens to deepen a wedge between the two powers. “We have 1,000 reasons to make China-U.S. relations work well and not a single reason to make China-U.S. relations bad,” Mr. Xi said while meeting with the Democratic senator from New York. Mr. Xi’s amicable tone is likely to increase expectations that he will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in San Francisco in November and meet with President Biden. Doing so would cap a tumultuous year for U.S.-China relations that reached a low in February after the discovery of a Chinese surveillance balloon over the United States. Still, the specter of a growing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians could complicate any bid to improve ties between Beijing and Washington. Mr. Schumer, who is in China leading a bipartisan congressional delegation, told Mr. Xi that he was “disappointed” by China’s lack of sympathy for Israel in its official response to the attack by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, on Israel. “I urge you and the Chinese people to stand with the Israeli people and condemn the cowardly and vicious attacks,” Mr. Schumer told Mr. Xi. Mr. Schumer said during a news conference after the meeting with Mr. Xi that he had requested that “China use its influence in Iran to not allow the conflagration to spread.” “They have influence with Iran in many different ways, and we asked them to do everything they could to not have Iran spread this conflagration through themselves and through Hezbollah,” he said, referring to the Lebanese militant group backed by Tehran. Asked how the Chinese side responded, Mr. Schumer said, “They said they would deliver the message.” China has refrained from condemning Hamas for the attacks, opting instead to continue casting itself as a neutral party in the long-running conflict. “China is a common friend of both Israel and Palestine,” Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, said at a regular news briefing on Monday. An editorial published on Monday in the Global Times, which is affiliated with a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, blamed Western countries for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in an effort it said was led by the United States. It also warned that taking sides on the issue now would only add “fuel to the fire.” China will most likely face growing pressure to support Israel — not unlike the calls that Beijing is facing to push Russia to end its fighting in Ukraine. Yuval Waks, a senior official at the Israeli Embassy in Beijing, said on Sunday that he expected “stronger condemnation” of Hamas from China. Tuvia Gering, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Diane and Guilford Glazer Center at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel, said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that “China’s moral compass” was “broken.” “As the Jewish Talmud says, silence is acquiescence,” Mr. Gering wrote on Monday. While China and Israel maintain robust trade and investment ties, particularly as it relates to technology and infrastructure, their relationship is ultimately restrained by Israel’s deep alignment with the United States and China’s friendship with Iran. China has a strategic interest in trying to be friends with all governments in the region; it garners much of its oil imports from the Middle East and considers it a key node along its Belt and Road trade network. As the United States has drawn down its presence in the region, Mr. Xi has even tried to enhance his clout in the Middle East by helping restore diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two archrivals, in March. The next month, China offered to mediate Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Though those talks never gained momentum, experts say China could still contribute in a constructive way by offering to mediate the release of civilian hostages held by Hamas. One of those hostages is believed to be a woman of Chinese descent who was abducted Saturday by militants at a music festival, the Chinese Embassy in Israel said on the Chinese platform Weibo on Sunday. “China has an opportunity to showcase its leadership and mediation prowess in a more substantial way,” said Gedaliah Afterman, the head of the Asia Policy Program at the Abba Eban Institute for Diplomacy and Foreign Relations at Reichman University in Israel. “Successfully doing so,” he added, “would not only mitigate regional tensions but also solidify China’s reputation as a key player in fostering de-escalation and sustaining regional stability.” '),(22,'Head to East Bay, Rhode Island, for an Idyllic Fall Weekend Getaway','The farm stands, art galleries and land-conservation efforts in the East Bay region show why fall is the golden season in the Ocean State.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/travel/east-bay-rhode-island.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:00:36 +0000','“We’re growing a small business and learning as we go,” said Claire Bowen as she arranged bushels of sweet and charmingly imperfect organic apples on a late-September afternoon. “We hope to cultivate connections between local farms and local tables.” Behind her, rows of brightly hued zinnias and an orchard of 700 apple trees swayed in the fall breeze. Mrs. Bowen, 55, opened Small World Farm and its farm stand with her husband, Patrick, in August and since then their post-and-beam barn has overflowed with autumn’s bounty: bundles of herbs and hand-tied flower bouquets sit next to baskets of apples, squash and peppers. Farther down the winding country roads lies the Young Family Farm’s stand, where cheery orange pumpkins sit alongside buckets of jewel-toned mums, and Sweet & Salty Farm, a dairy and creamery selling cheese and yogurt from cows that graze in pastures tumbling down to the ocean’s edge. This rural town, with no franchises or traffic lights, is Little Compton, one of several coastal enclaves in the East Bay region of Rhode Island. At this time of year, the sun casts a golden light over rolling farmland and colonial stone walls, with fall leaves painting the landscape in a palette of amber and scarlet. To the west is the striking blue Narragansett Bay, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean that divides the state. Beyond the natural grandeur of the East Bay, its charm further stems from a strong sense of community and a reverence for local culinary, artistic and cultural pursuits that are closely tied to the region’s fertile farmland and coastal waters. The results are farm stands galore, a flourishing arts scene and village streets lined with celebrated restaurants. Just 30 minutes from Providence, over an hour from Boston and four hours from New York City, the East Bay towns of Warren, Bristol, Tiverton and Little Compton offer an idyllic fall weekend getaway. Rhode Islanders joke that their real summer begins now, that the state’s true beauty unfurls as tourists disperse and the hot weather recedes. With 400 miles of shoreline, the aptly named Ocean State probably packs more beauty within its borders than almost any other coastal destination. The distance between towns is short — from Warren to Little Compton is roughly 20 miles — and quiet solitude and brilliant seaside views can be found in local nature preserves and public gardens as well as on beaches. Blithewold, a 33-acre oceanfront estate in Bristol, features an English-country-manor-style home and gardens that overlook the bay, while other standouts include Seapowet Marsh, a teeming ecosystem ripe for wildlife spotting; Fogland Beach, a black-stone shoreline perfect for kayaking and windsurfing; and Goosewing Beach Preserve, a sandy barrier strip with grassy dunes. Get the lay of the land by hitting the East Bay Bike Path, a 14.3-mile route that begins in Providence and weaves through Warren and Bristol’s coves, marshes, parks and bridges along the shore of the bay. While many coastal communities fall prey to overdevelopment, there has been a concerted community effort toward conservation, which has resulted in the preservation of thousands of acres for farming, forestry and outdoor recreation. The Sakonnet Preservation Association, which was founded in 1972 as the state’s first private, nonprofit community land trust, has conserved more than 467 acres, while the Little Compton Agricultural Conservancy has preserved, or been a partner in preserving, more than 2,000 acres. The Tiverton Land Trust has preserved more than 690 acres. The East Bay once served exclusively as home to the Indigenous Wampanoag tribe. Crops like corn, beans and squash flourished in rich soil, and quahogging (digging for clams) and fishing provided sustenance. Starting in the early 1900s, Portuguese farmers and fishermen settled there, introducing new traditions and flavors. Agriculture and fishing continue to thrive in the region despite challenges — including overfishing, extreme weather events and the rising price of farmland — and have shaped its culinary scene. It all starts with quality ingredients; sourcing them is half the fun. In Warren, the women-owned Long Lane Farm stretches its growing season into the winter: It can offer an array of greens — spinach, lettuce, bok choy, kale and chard — thanks to high-tunnel growing. Nearby, Sowams Cider Works produces effervescent hard cider from apples grown in its three-and-a-half-acre orchard; with no additives or sulfur, its hard cider depends on native and selected yeasts to ferment and mature. “I have about 1,000 trees and at least 70 varieties of apples,” said the owner, Spencer Morris, 67. “Each batch of cider is truly an expression of the fruit.” The harvest season begins in mid-August and continues through December. “This business is primarily a farming enterprise,” he said. “I wouldn’t be making cider if I didn’t grow the fruit and have control over the varietals, the way they are grown and the harvest timeline.” Bristol’s 127-acre Mount Hope Farm hosts year-round Saturday morning farmers’ markets. Make a day of it and explore the farm’s pathways, trails and gardens. In Little Compton, the Wishing Stone Farm celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, and its farm stand teems with produce grown across its 40 acres and in its 15 greenhouses, as well as prepared and preserved foods like soups, salsas and pickles. Andrade’s Catch, a family-run fish market in Bristol, has sold locally caught seafood since 1987. “We work with about 50 fishers from across the region,” said Davy Andrade, who has been running the business for the last eight years alongside his father, David. Come autumn, expect to find cases full of black sea bass, crabs, scallops, quahogs and steamer clams, in addition to cod, sole, yellowfin tuna and swordfish. Hunky Dory in Warren encapsulates the region’s field-to-fork, ocean-to-plate sensibility. Sam Duling, chef and co-owner, regularly visits a roster of farms and purveyors to decide what best captures the seasonal moment. “Sam is one of the only chefs that comes into the shop to check out our catch instead of just relying on deliveries,” Mr. Andrade said. The result is a menu that emphasizes seasonal produce and protein: Hand-rolled cavatelli served with vegetables and ricotta. Fresh black sea bass grilled and glazed with a preserved-strawberry barbecue sauce. Crispy biscuit fritters served with a spicy honey drizzle. “I grew up with a Southern mother and grandmother, so my roots are Lowcountry cuisine and Appalachian cooking, the kind of food that relies on what’s in season,” said Mr. Duling, 37. When he arrived in Rhode Island, the abundance of farmers and purveyors made him feel at home. And starting a restaurant in the pandemic — Hunky Dory opened in May 2021 — gave him an even greater appreciation for the community. “In order for restaurants and farms to survive, we need to do it together,” Mr. Duling said. The area’s emphasis on keeping things local extends well beyond the culinary realm. Many alumni of the Rhode Island School of Design, in nearby Providence, stay close after graduation, drawn by the natural environment as well as tax incentives. Warren, for one, allows artists who live and work in a specific arts district area to forgo state sales tax and income tax on the sale of artwork, but co-working spaces, workshops, arts nonprofits and galleries are spread around the entire East Bay. At 30 Cutler, a mill now converted into studio spaces, the RISD graduate Jonathan Glatt houses the showroom, office and factory of his furniture company, O & G Studio. The company designs and manufactures heirloom-quality modern Windsor chairs and other pieces. For visitors interested in art and shopping, there’s still time to catch the tail end of the Warren Walkabout — a downtown street event held on Oct. 15, 22 and 29 from noon to 5 p.m. Many participating spaces exhibit local work, including the Imago Foundation for the Arts, a gallery this year celebrating its 20th anniversary of championing local art. But on any day of the week, shops on Water and Main Streets sell thoughtfully curated wares, like the vintage jewelry at Muse or metalwork and home goods at Beehive Handmade. South of Warren, the town center of Tiverton Four Corners also offers delightful art and shopping. Having earned its spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, the two-block stretch is currently full of galleries, antique stores and eateries. Standouts include Four Corners Gallery, the Ashley Ainsworth Art gallery and studio, and Arch Contemporary Ceramics, which serves as a ceramics studio, an artist residency program and a high-end pottery shop. In 2020, Groundswell joined the Four Corners community by setting up shops, each with their own unique offerings, in three separate historic buildings — a brainchild of David Fierabend, a landscape architect and principal of Groundswell Design Group, as well as a Tiverton resident. In the buildings that now house a cafe, home-goods store and gardening shop, shelves brim with baked goods, kitchenware, gardening décor and terrariums. Outside are gardens adorned with fountains, cafe tables and pollinator plants. Visitors are invited to explore. “Like most hidden gems, Rhode Island is nuanced, but as you peel back its layers, you are privy to the beauty, the bounty and the community that binds us,” Mr. Fierabend said.

It’s Hurricane Resistant.','After Hurricane Sandy flooded a Coney Island hospital, New York City built a new one that could withstand rising waters and flying debris.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/nyregion/coney-island-hospital-hurricane.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 14:41:36 +0000','New York City is about to cut the ribbon on a new $923 million public hospital building, not far from the beach in Coney Island, that is designed to be practically flood-proof and that promises to elevate the level of health care for hundreds of thousands of people in South Brooklyn. The new Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospital building, which opens to patients on Sunday, was born out of a crisis. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Coney Island Hospital, the former name of the campus where the new building is, flooded. Seawater poured into the emergency room. A turtle washed up in the I.T. department. Some 370 patients were evacuated. When it came time to restore the facility, city hospital leaders convinced the Federal Emergency Management Agency that constructing a new building would cost the same as repairing and retrofitting the old one. With nearly $1 billion from the agency, the city’s public hospital system was able to construct a fortress, designed to withstand even a once-in-a-century flood. A four-foot-tall barrier wall rings most of the hospital campus. Self-rising or sliding barriers can be closed at all entrances. The mechanical systems, including two generators as large as freight train engines, are housed on the new building’s fifth floor. The emergency room, painted a calming shade of blue, is on the second floor, above the worst flood projections, with double the space of the old one. The building is sheathed in a glass curtain wall that is resistant to hurricane damage and built to withstand “large and small missile impact,” meaning it will not break even if hit with large flying debris, said John Flanagan, an architect on the project from the firm NBBJ. The biggest upgrade is for the hospital’s dozens of behavioral health patients. They will move from a 1910 building that will now be demolished to the top floors of the new 11-story tower, where they will have sweeping views and a dedicated outdoor space. A bronze statue of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg presides over the new lobby. The building, which broke ground in 2018, was named for her in 2022 to honor her commitment to equity and justice, said Svetlana Lipyanskaya, the chief executive of NYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health. “When I say we’re an anchor in this community, we literally built a fort,” she said. The updated systems and design are expected to improve the experience of patients at a facility that last received a one-star-out- of-five ranking from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In the old main building, some rooms housed four patients each, making infection control more difficult. The new building, which will be just one of several facilities for patients on the South Brooklyn Health campus, has 80 single rooms, with pullout couches for relatives to spend the night. “We didn’t want to look like a city hospital,” said Daniel Collins, the senior associate director of facilities at the South Brooklyn Health campus. “We wanted to look like a hospital. And I think they achieved it very well.” '),(2,'NY Medicaid Patients Win Dental Settlement, Expanding Coverage for 5 Million','A class-action lawsuit will expand the state’s Medicaid rules, which lawyers argued were “structured to pull your teeth rather than save them.”','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/nyregion/ny-medicaid-dental-settlement.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 18:21:06 +0000','Matthew Adinolfi, who has no top teeth and had no love life for over a decade, will be able to get implants so that he can kiss a woman without fear of his dentures falling out. Blanca Coreas, who can’t eat anything firmer than mashed potatoes without her gums bleeding, will be able to take a bite of grilled meat. Lillian Velazquez has now gotten the root canal that was denied for nearly five years. A class-action suit that was settled on Monday will bring about a change that is as potentially transformative as it is mundane: coverage of common but costly dental procedures for the five million adults in New York State who are on Medicaid, including implants, root canals and replacement dentures. The suit, filed in 2018 in federal court against the State Health Department, which oversees Medicaid in New York, charged the state with denying thousands of low-income New Yorkers medically necessary treatment. Medicaid programs, which vary from state to state, are not required to cover dental care; several states do not. But under federal law, if a state Medicaid program does cover an optional category of care — such as dentistry, prescription drugs or optometry — it must cover all medically necessary care in that category. The suit argued that dental health was essential not just to overall physical health but also to psychological well-being and the ability to find or keep a job. “You need to have teeth to function in our society,” said Belkys Garcia, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, which filed the suit. “It impacts everything in your life — your relationships, how people see themselves, how others see you.” For decades, Ms. Garcia said, New York’s coverage rules for Medicaid were “structured to pull your teeth rather than save them.” And because one of the main jobs of a tooth is to hold its neighbors in place, an extraction often has a domino effect: Losing teeth leads to losing more teeth. “Once you start missing one tooth, the teeth start shifting,” said Victor Badner, chairman of dentistry at Jacobi Medical Center, a city-run hospital in the Bronx. Dr. Badner filed a declaration in the case describing the dental needs of one of the plaintiffs. Under the newly covered benefits, he said, “The vast majority of patients who otherwise would end up losing more teeth may instead be able to save them.” New York already had “one of the more generous” Medicaid dental programs in its range of services covered, said Colin Reusch, director of policy for Community Catalyst, a health care consumer advocacy group. But he added: “The devil’s in the details in terms of how these policies come into play for people who are in urgent need of specific care.” Under the old rules, root canals and crowns on back teeth were covered only if a diseased tooth was essential to anchoring a denture or if extracting it was medically inadvisable. Replacements for broken or lost dentures were covered only if the dentures were at least eight years old. Implants were not covered at all. The suit’s lead plaintiff, Frank Ciaramella, died in 2020. In 2018, his dentures were destroyed after he sneezed; they fell out and were run over by a car. Under the old limits, he was not eligible for new dentures until 2024. Mr. Adinolfi, 65, former New York City cabdriver who is on disability for a back injury and lives upstate near Plattsburgh, had all but three teeth pulled around 2010 after contracting a mouth infection so severe doctors feared it would spread to his organs. “It was either pull the teeth out or die,” he said. The dentures he received through Medicaid never fit and would not stay in place, making them impossible to eat with. He eventually paid for a permanent bridge for his lower front teeth, but could not afford one in back. Years of using his upper gums to chew down on his bottom denture have left the gums damaged. He needs implants to hold his upper denture in place, but Medicaid did not cover them. As bad as the discomfort and difficulty eating have been, the effect on his social life has been at least as bad. He did not have a relationship for over 10 years “because I just get to a point where you want to take it to the next level, and then that’s it,” Mr. Adinolfi said. “If I take the denture out you can notice how sucked-in my face is — it’s just very embarrassing on my part.” (He now has a girlfriend for the first time since his teeth were pulled.) The settlement obligates New York Medicaid to cover implants, replacement dentures and most root canals if a dentist authorizes the procedures. The settlement also does away with a rule that denied coverage for many procedures to people who still had four matched upper and lower pairs of back teeth, which the state had “considered adequate for functional purposes.” Mary Eaton, a lawyer with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which joined Legal Aid’s suit, said that the dental problems addressed by the rules were “issues that everybody faces, regardless of your economic status.” But Medicaid recipients tend to have more, and more complex, health problems than the population at large, often the result of lifelong poverty and inadequate medical care. Ms. Garcia said she had seen many clients “take on terrible credit card debt” to pay for basic dental procedures. The gaps in Medicaid’s dental coverage also worsened racial health disparities. Ms. Garcia said that Black and brown adults suffer from untreated dental disease at nearly twice the rate as white adults. The State Health Department, which twice attempted to get the case dismissed, said in a statement Monday afternoon that the settlement “recognizes the importance of oral health and affirms the state’s commitment” to people on Medicaid. Wesley R. Powell, a lawyer with Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which also joined Legal Aid in the suit, said that in the long run, because so many teeth will be saved from extraction, the changes may well save the state money. Ms. Coreas, 62, an ex-cafeteria worker in the Bronx, is another plaintiff in the lawsuit. Her dental problems have led to digestive problems, vitamin deficiency, frequent oral bleeding and depression, according to the lawsuit. She said she isolated herself socially because people sometimes made fun of her appearance. In 2019, when Medicaid rejected a request for implants, which she needs to effectively wear dentures, she thought about suicide. “I felt like I had no support from anyone,” she said. Ms. Velazquez had had an upper molar filled a number of times, but the filling kept falling out. Her dentist said the tooth needed a root canal and crown but Medicaid would not cover it, noting that extracting the tooth would still leave her with four matched pairs of back teeth. For years she avoided eating on the left side to preserve the delicate tooth. She went through tube after tube of over-the-counter tooth cement. Under an agreement reached before the settlement, Medicaid covered her root canal. Mr. Adinolfi’s path to dental functionality will be more arduous. He has lost so much bone above the gum that he may need a graft of bone from elsewhere in his body or implants anchored into his cheekbone. He faces months of surgeries and many hours in the dentist’s chair. “I can’t wait,” he said. “I can’t wait.” '),(3,'Trump’s Lawyers Fight Bragg’s Effort to Limit Access to Evidence','Manhattan prosecutors had asked a judge to bar Donald Trump from discussing certain evidence publicly or on social media.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/nyregion/trump-bragg-criminal-case-evidence.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 22:42:13 +0000','Lawyers for Donald J. Trump on Monday pushed back against an effort by the Manhattan district attorney’s office to limit the former president’s ability to publicly discuss evidence in the criminal case against him. The district attorney’s office last week asked the judge in the case to restrict Mr. Trump’s access to some case material. The office requested that the former president be barred from reviewing the material without his lawyers present, and more broadly from publicizing the prosecution’s evidence on social media or through other channels. In a court filing, Mr. Trump’s lawyers called the prosecutors’ request “extreme.” They argued that any restrictions placed on Mr. Trump should apply to prosecutors as well, and said that barring the former president from discussing evidence would violate his First Amendment rights. “President Trump is the leading Republican candidate for president of the United States,” the filing said. “To state the obvious, there will continue to be significant public commentary about this case and his candidacy, to which he has a right and a need to respond, both for his own sake and for the benefit of the voting public.” Mr. Trump has been charged with 34 felonies by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, who accused the former president of trying to cover up a potential sex scandal during the 2016 presidential campaign. At a news conference after Mr. Trump was arraigned last month, Mr. Bragg argued that Mr. Trump repeatedly made false statements to conceal a $130,000 hush-money payment made on his behalf to a porn star, Stormy Daniels. Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Todd Blanche, Susan R. Necheles and Joseph Tacopina, said in the court filing that Mr. Bragg made statements at the news conference that would have violated the restrictions he sought had it applied to him. They said that before Mr. Bragg took the podium, they had been nearing an agreement with prosecutors on the terms of an order that would have limited the former president’s access to evidence. Prosecutors “apparently believe that New York law allows the district attorney’s office and its witnesses to freely speak and quote from grand jury evidence, but not President Trump or his counsel,” the filing said, taking aim at Ms. Daniels, as well as the former fixer who paid her, Michael D. Cohen. A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said that they also took issue with the protective order — the document in which prosecutors specified their proposed restrictions on access to case material — to the extent that it prevented Mr. Trump from discussing the prosecution’s evidence. And they disputed prosecutors’ argument that Mr. Trump has a history of attacking law enforcement officials who have investigated him. “This ‘history,’ according to the People, justifies an extremely restrictive protective order that, if entered, would severely hamper President Trump’s ability to publicly defend himself and prepare for trial,” they wrote. '),(4,'Day 4 of the Trump Rape Case: Carroll’s Cross-Examination Is Complete','E. Jean Carroll has accused Donald J. Trump of assaulting her, and the ex-president’s lawyer tried to cast doubt on her story. More witnesses are expected Tuesday.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/nyregion/trump-carroll-rape-suit-cross-examination.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 23:40:52 +0000','E. Jean Carroll, the writer who has sued former President Donald J. Trump, accusing him of rape, completed three days on the witness stand Monday in a civil trial in Manhattan federal court, with a lawyer for Mr. Trump continuing to try to show up inconsistencies in her testimony. The stage was set for Ms. Carroll’s lawyers to call additional witnesses to bolster her case. Monday was the second of two days of cross-examination of Ms. Carroll by lawyer Joseph Tacopina about her allegation that the ex-president raped her in a dressing room in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. Mr. Trump, who has avoided coming to court, has denied all wrongdoing. On Monday morning, the former president’s lawyers filed an unsuccessful motion for a mistrial, arguing that the court had made “pervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings.”  Ms. Carroll says she visited Bergdorf Goodman one evening in the mid-1990s. As she was leaving through a revolving door, Mr. Trump entered and recognized her, the suit says, and persuaded her to help him shop for a gift for a female friend. She has accused the former president of going on to attack her in a dressing room in the lingerie department. Mr. Tacopina, in his questioning, focused on Ms. Carroll’s memory of what happened that day some 30 years ago. On Monday, he used his cross-examination to point out inconsistencies between her testimony and her previous interviews and depositions, trying to suggest that she had benefited from making the allegation. Mr. Tacopina asked about her 2019 appearance on an episode of a podcast called “The Maris Review,” during which Ms. Carroll said her life was “fabulous.” “It is the way I present myself to the world,” Ms. Carroll testified. “I do not want anyone to know that I suffered,” she added. Mr. Tacopina also focused on her testimony that she had been fired from Elle magazine after Mr. Trump denied her allegation in 2019 and called her a liar. Mr. Tacopina questioned Ms. Carroll about an email exchange in which she suggested she was fired because she published an excerpt from her book in a competing outlet, New York Magazine. Ms. Carroll acknowledged that Nina Garcia, the editor in chief of Elle magazine, was “very angry” at her, but added that she took a hit when Mr. Trump “called me a liar for three straight days.” “My trustworthiness was exploded,” Ms. Carroll said. “It was like — just crumbled, the foundation on which the whole column had rested for 27 years.” Mr. Tacopina appeared to struggle to get into any sort of rhythm during his cross-examination, with Ms. Carroll’s lawyers frequently objecting to questions and the judge sustaining those objections. At times, Mr. Tacopina struggled to even get his team to display evidence for the court. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan denied a motion filed by Mr. Tacopina asking him to declare a mistrial. Among other complaints, Mr. Tacopina argued that the judge mischaracterized evidence to favor Ms. Carroll and improperly bolster her testimony; allowed her to note that Mr. Trump had two tables’ worth of lawyers while prohibiting the defense from noting she had a similar number; and wrongly sustained “argumentative” objections to his questions. “There comes a point where the cumulative effect of its one-sided rulings manifests a deeper leaning towards one party or another,” Mr. Tacopina wrote. Since lawyers gave their opening statements last week, Ms. Carroll has been the main witness. She related her story in graphic detail, testifying that she told two friends within a day of the attack. One told Ms. Carroll that what she had experienced was rape and that she needed to tell the police. A second told her not to tell anyone because Mr. Trump was powerful and his lawyers would bury her. She kept silent for decades before writing about the event in a 2019 memoir. Ms. Carroll sued Mr. Trump in November under a law that grants adult sexual abuse victims a one-year window to bring civil lawsuits against people they say abused them. Her lawsuit asks that a jury find Mr. Trump liable for battery and defamation, order him to retract statements questioning her truthfulness and award her monetary damages. The jury will determine how much, if anything, to award Ms. Carroll based on the suffering jury members believe she experienced. It’s unclear who will testify next. Shawn G. Crowley, a lawyer for Ms. Carroll, said last week that the jury would hear from the two friends that Ms. Carroll confided in immediately after the alleged rape, Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin. Ms. Crowley also said the jury will hear from several other witnesses, including Dr. Leslie Lebowitz, a clinical psychologist and trauma specialist; a professor who is an expert in sociology and communications, Ashlee Humphreys; and two other women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff. '),(5,'He Bombed the Nazis. 75 Years Later, the Nightmares Began.','Like most of his generation, John Wenzel returned from World War II with no interest in sharing memories. Just shy of his 100th birthday, he found he could no longer ignore the past.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/veteran-nightmares-nazi.html','Sun, 30 Apr 2023 07:00:11 +0000','The nightmare shook the old man, who was now in his late 90s. He dreamed of falling from the sky. He awoke feeling helpless and afraid. John Wenzel, a veteran, automotive executive, father and grandfather, had recently moved into a senior living apartment in Brooklyn Heights, the Watermark on Clark Street, a new, frills-and-all building with a Manhattan skyline view. He would soon turn 99 and become the oldest resident there. Since his wife, Alice, died more than 10 years earlier, he had settled into a quiet rhythm, alone with his jazz records and his painting. And suddenly, out of nowhere, these nightmares. He feared he had suffered a seizure, but his vital signs were normal. His adult daughters, Emily and Abby, were also worried. Their father had always been so steady and predictable and was never prone to this sort of profound disquiet. Looking for its source would send Mr. Wenzel and his daughters on a journey back more than 70 years, to a time and a place he had worked purposely his entire adult life to leave behind, to World War II and the skies above Italy. Emily and Abby were young girls when they learned their father had fought in the war. They remember a day the family visited their grandmother’s house and she proudly pulled four slender boxes from a drawer. Inside were several medals on bright ribbons. “She wanted us to take them home,” Abby Wenzel, now 63, recently recalled. The girls were intensely curious — the medals were so beautiful — but their father’s response was immediate: “He said, ‘I got those in the war, and I don’t want them.’” And so the medals stayed out of sight, where he preferred them, for decades. There are fewer and fewer soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen who lived through World War II. Close to 16 million Americans served in the war; 99 percent of them are now dead. Like Mr. Wenzel, many of these veterans put the war behind them. Much has been written about “the Greatest Generation” and its valor abroad, as well as its humility back home. This narrative masked the individuals and the personal tolls they would pay. Over the years, the girls came to understand that their father had been a fighter pilot and that he had been wounded — in his rear end. This never failed to make them laugh. Did he need special pants? A special chair? And he would grin and endure their gentle teasing. He was a warm and funny man, but that grin was about all anyone got out of him on that subject. The family lived in Sea Cliff, on Long Island. Mr. Wenzel had worked at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City before joining Ideal Corporation, which manufactured stainless steel hose clamps for automobiles and aircraft in East New York. He worked his way up and eventually became president of the company. He retired and played a lot of golf until his aging body caught up with him. Finally, in 2023, living in Brooklyn and stooped and slowed by a broken hip, his 100th birthday approaching, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the stress he survived as a younger man. The nightmares sent his daughters back to those little rectangular boxes they had first seen at their grandmother’s. They brought them to their father, along with some typed notes he’d written at some point, as he began to finally speak about his time in the war. The writings begin abruptly. On Dec. 7, 1941, breaking news interrupted a game of bridge at Lafayette College, a liberal arts school in Pennsylvania. “Train came down from N.Y. with many guys like me,” he wrote. “I joined them.” The attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States and millions of its young men into uniform. John Wenzel was 19 when he enlisted and was dispatched to flight school in Miami. He had never even been on an airplane, but he emerged in 1944 as a fighter pilot and was sent off to the Italian front to fight the Nazis. He would fly the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber, the lone occupant of an eight-ton weapon when fully loaded. “I never got good at marching or saluting,” he wrote, “but they made me a pretty good pilot.” Lieutenant Wenzel flew scattered missions in Northern Italy, near Milan, and just over the Austrian border in early 1945. His bombs destroyed Axis railroad cars and a large gasoline truck outside a depot in Trento. In February, he bombed and strafed more than a dozen enemy cars with machine guns in Lienz, Austria. He severed a rail line and fired rockets at stalled enemy train cars in Novara in March. But it was all just a lead-up to April 1945. Fighting was furious then on the Italian ground, with the Allies depending on the roaring Thunderbolts overhead near Verona and along the Po River south of Milan. Lieutenant Wenzel was flying several attack missions every week, guiding his team through bad weather and, in Air Force parlance, “persistent and accurate antiaircraft fire.” “The irony,” he wrote later in his notes, “is that we were working harder than ever, flying some of our best missions, but for the first time we talked openly about survival.” He eluded enemy fire for the first 13 days of April. On April 14, Lieutenant Wenzel led a team of four fighter planes, providing air support for units pushing toward a rail hub in the town of Zocca. Lieutenant Wenzel scored a direct hit with his bombs, destroying enemy guns. Then a German shell burst right outside his cockpit. Fragments sliced into his plane, tearing his uniform. Bleeding from his neck, he circled around for another attack before guiding his heavily damaged aircraft back to the base. His actions that day would earn him a Purple Heart, but first, Lieutenant Wenzel returned to the air. “German troops were on both sides of the river and were beating our guys up with all kinds of guns,” Lieutenant Wenzel wrote later. His team flew toward a farmhouse that held a machine-gun nest. “On our first pass, there were plenty of tracers coming at us, and I got hit from underneath,” he wrote. “It felt like somebody had paddled my rear end.” He asked another pilot to fly under his plane to eyeball the damage. Looks OK, the pilot reported, even as smoke started to fill Lieutenant Wenzel’s cockpit and his parachute seemed to be on fire. He radioed his fellow pilots to coordinate another pass on the farmhouse. An officer got on the radio: “‘Don’t be a jerk, John. Go home.’” The officer, Joseph Dickerson, was a captain and outranked the lieutenant. “But I didn’t have a military discipline handbook with me,” Mr. Wenzel wrote. “We told him we were having too much fun to go home.” The team attacked their target again until, satisfied, they turned toward Pisa and their air base. But Lieutenant Wenzel’s troubles were mounting. “I began to think that old Joe was right,” he wrote. “The fire had consumed most of my chute, plus the seat of my pants, and was starting on my seatbelt, which burned like the wick to a cheap firecracker.” He couldn’t eject without a parachute, and opening the cockpit would feed the flames with oxygen. His only option was to push on to Pisa. He finally landed, and a crew hurried to extinguish the flames. A doctor “pulled a few steel splinters out of me” and treated him with burn ointment. He wisecracked: “My request for a replacement pair of trousers was denied.” Earning a Purple Heart is usually a source of great pride, a testament to surviving an injury in combat. Earning two Purple Hearts in eight days would seem to place a man in the company of the very, very lucky. Lieutenant Wenzel shipped back home in late 1945. He graduated from Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, and ended up in New York City. He found an apartment on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. But for a buddy or two from the service, he was alone. He liked to paint in a studio he rented for $20 a month on the Lower East Side. After a day of painting, he would walk toward home, but not quite get there. The first stop instead was the San Remo Cafe, also on Macdougal. The place, like the surrounding city, would have been thick with unmoored young veterans like himself, and Mr. Wenzel found comfort in their company — “people like me,” he’d say later — without exactly interacting with them. He drank a lot, and he kept to himself. He would go on to call this “the dark times,” and once told a grandnephew that he was “a mess” then. Eventually, he discovered his instinct for business. He met a young social worker, Alice Newman, and they married and started a family. He stayed busy, and the war faded into the background. And, for more than 70 years, that was where the war stayed. The nightmares arrived when he moved into his Brooklyn apartment — so vivid he believed they were real and scolded his home nurse for not saving him. Doctors could find no physical cause for the panic. A sleep specialist suggested he speak to a therapist. His daughters set him up with a counselor over Zoom, who suggested he consider opening up more about his past. And the stories slowly revealed themselves. The Wenzel daughters found their father, far out of character, eager to share. In early March, shortly before his 100th birthday, Mr. Wenzel agreed to an interview, conducted in his living room. Beside him were his medals, the first time he’d seen them in decades — a Distinguished Flying Cross, an Air Medal, a Silver Star, his two Purple Hearts. His vision and hearing diminished, he spoke with effort about staying quiet for so long. “There was no place to talk about it, and no way to express myself,” he said. He glanced toward the medals. “For many years, these were tucked away. We didn’t have much reason to pull them out.” He said that right after the war, even in a downtown bar filled with other soldiers, it was unbecoming to seem to seek attention. “Nobody asked me about it,” he said. “I didn’t bring it up.” He became aware of reunions of his old fighter squadron. He rarely went. “I didn’t see why I should spend my time …” His voice trailed off. Years ago, his wife wanted to visit Italy and, in particular, Venice. No, thanks, he said reflexively. Not Venice. “There were certain places you weren’t supposed to bomb or shoot up,” he explained recently. “Venice was one of them.” He recalls flying over the untouchable city. “German soldiers had occupied Venice, and were enjoying the sunshine and whatever else they got in Venice,” he recalled. It angered him. Eventually, he relented and visited the city with Alice. “She liked Venice,” he said. “I didn’t.” He chuckled. He said he hoped stories like his would keep the war from being forgotten. “I’m afraid people are going to take it lightly — it shouldn’t be taken lightly,” he said. “They’ve got their own wars, and World War II is getting to be smaller and smaller.” The bravado he had once shown in his writing — “too much fun to go home” — long ago fled him. The medals, for years hidden away, have filled that space. “I found I needed to look at them,” Mr. Wenzel said. The nightmares have stopped. '),(6,'After Student’s Suicide, an Elite School Says It Fell ‘Tragically Short’','The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey on Sunday made a remarkable admission of failure and committed to a new focus on mental health.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/lawrenceville-school-suicide.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 19:22:20 +0000','Last April, Jack Reid, a 17-year-old junior at one of the nation’s elite boarding schools, tucked a Bible into his gym shorts and a note into his pocket directing his parents to a Google document explaining his feelings of despair. Then, inside his dorm room, he took his own life. On Sunday, the anniversary of Jack’s death, the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey offered an extraordinary admission of failure, publicly acknowledging that it had been aware that Jack was being bullied by other students, but that it had fallen “tragically short” of its obligation to protect him. “The school acknowledges that bullying and unkind behavior, and actions taken or not taken by the school, likely contributed to Jack’s death,” Lawrenceville officials wrote in a statement posted Sunday morning on the school’s website. The school committed to taking a series of corrective actions including endowing a new dean’s position that will be focused on mental health issues, with a goal of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health. The statement was part of a negotiated settlement with Jack’s parents, Elizabeth and Bill Reid. It offered a candid and detailed catalog of the school’s missteps before Jack’s death and a window into the culture of a private institution where tuition plus room and board top $76,000 a year. It also represents shifting attitudes surrounding the mental health crisis among teenagers and the role of bullying in an always complex set of factors that can contribute to suicide. “We feel like we both have life sentences without the possibility of parole,” Dr. Reid, a clinical psychologist, said in an interview in which her husband also participated. “The only thing I’d love to change here is to get Jack back. I can’t.” She added, “I do know if he were alive, he would want me — both of us — to try to make something good out of this and honor him in the way he lived his life.” Richard Lieberman, the lead suicide prevention expert for the public school system in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest system, called Lawrenceville’s response rare — and courageous. He said he had never before heard of a school’s accepting responsibility so publicly after a suicide. “We need to talk more about this. We really do,” he said. “It’s a leading cause of death of our youth.” Jack was bullied over the course of a year, the school said in the statement posted on Sunday. After his suicide, the school’s board of trustees retained the law firm Petrillo Klein & Boxer to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death. The investigation included interviews with 45 students, faculty members and others, according to a detailed report on its findings, which the school provided to The New York Times. The firm also reviewed emails from more than 100 students and school personnel, as well as Jack’s personal emails, phone records, text messages and internet searches, the report said. “We said from the beginning, ‘Let’s seek the truth and follow it where it leads us. Period,’ ” Stephen S. Murray, Lawrenceville’s head of school, said on Sunday. “And that’s what we’ve tried to do every step of the way.” He added: “This happened on my watch and I’m grief stricken. And yet I can’t begin to compare that to the grief and sorrow of Bill and Elizabeth Reid.” Lawrenceville’s statement said that its settlement with the Reids was aimed at “honoring Jack, taking appropriate responsibility and instituting meaningful changes that will support the school’s aspirations of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health.” The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated an already worrying mental health emergency among teenagers, made worse by a severe shortage of therapists and treatment options and insufficient research to explain the trend. Nearly three in five girls reported feeling persistent sadness in 2021. Suicide rates also ticked up that year after a two-year decline, particularly in groups most affected by the pandemic, according to a report released in February by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Christine Yu Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said the causes of suicide were always complex and were never tied to only one stressor. “Bullying absolutely can be an important factor that can be part of the multi-factor convergence of things that culminates in suicide,” Dr. Moutier said in an interview, speaking generally and not about Jack Reid’s death or any other specific incident. “But it is not thought, in any case of suicide, to be the sole cause.” The law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, which represented the Reids, declined to comment on the settlement or whether it included a payment by the school to the family. Lawrenceville enrolls about 830 students on a spacious campus in western New Jersey, between Trenton and Princeton. It is considered by the school-ranking website Niche to be among the nation’s top 10 boarding schools. Before enrolling in Lawrenceville as a sophomore, Jack attended the Buckley School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he was recalled as a leader who consistently stood out for his kindness. Roughly 900 people attended a funeral service, Jack’s parents said, and 1,500 more watched it online. Jack’s early days at Lawrenceville, where he arrived as a 10th grader in the fall of 2020, were happy ones, his parents said. He made friends and the dean’s list. But in the spring of 2021, a persistent and untrue rumor that Jack was a rapist spread widely throughout the student body and led to cruel comments from some students, according to his parents. In September 2021, when he returned to school as a junior, he was nonetheless elected president of Dickinson House, one of the residential houses where the school’s boarding students live. That appears to have increased animosity among some of his classmates and caused the rumor to spread further, his parents said. A few days after the election, the unfounded rape accusation was posted anonymously to a nationwide, student-run app popular with boarding-school students, Jack’s parents said. The bullying spread quickly online, his parents said, and at Christmastime, during a secret Santa gift exchange among Lawrenceville classmates, Jack received a rape whistle and a book about how to make friends. Mr. Reid recalled that his son was hurt deeply, and that when Jack came home for Christmas he seemed withdrawn. “Dad, will this ever go away?” he said his son asked him, “Will it ever get off the website?” Mr. Reid noted that the in-person bullying at school combined with the power of the internet posting compounded the rumor’s impact. “We think bullying, with the 1,000 times echo chamber of the internet and everybody knowing, is much more devastating to kids and, in Jack’s case, produced a very impulsive act,” he said. “He had to escape the pain from the humiliation he was feeling.” Early on, with support from his parents, Jack approached school officials and asked them to intervene, leading to a school-led investigation surrounding the bullying and the sexual assault allegation. The school inquiry found that the claim was bogus, and a classmate involved in spreading the rumors, who was later expelled for an unrelated violation of school rules, was formally disciplined for bullying Jack, according to the school’s statement. But Lawrenceville never told Jack or his family — or anyone else — that the investigation had concluded that the rumors involving a sexual assault were utterly false. “There were steps that the school should in hindsight have taken but did not, including the fact that the school did not make a public or private statement that it investigated and found rumors about Jack that were untrue,” Lawrenceville said in the statement. The school and the Reids also tried unsuccessfully to get comments related to the sexual assault claims removed from the app. The school also acknowledged that it had erred more specifically on the night Jack took his life, just hours after the classmate involved in the bullying was formally expelled. Instead of being supervised as he packed his belongings, the boy was permitted to participate in a drawn-out farewell that included a final run around campus and a group photograph. During the gathering, some students also made harsh comments about Jack, inaccurately blaming him for the boy’s expulsion. “School administrators did not notify or check on Jack,” the school’s statement acknowledged. “That night, Jack took his life, telling a friend that he could not go through this again.” Dr. Reid said that Jack had been seeing a therapist at the time of his death because of the bullying, but that he had never discussed killing himself. Jack also displayed none of the underlying factors that might have indicated he was at risk for suicide, she said. The school said that it would contribute to a foundation the Reid family has established that will focus on education and prevention of bullying, and that it would make a recurring gift to a mental health organization to support research and best practices for suicide prevention in school environments. Public schools in most states are governed by laws that regulate the investigation and response to behavior considered bullying and require instruction aimed at limiting its spread. But private, parochial and boarding schools have far more autonomy in deciding how to address bullying. Mr. Reid said that the family also hoped to lobby for legislation in New York and New Jersey in an effort to broaden laws tied to bullying at private schools. Lawrenceville said in its statement that it would contract with a specialist to draft policies to identify and address behaviors that lead to school bullying and cyberbullying. “We acknowledge,” the school said, “that more should have been done to protect Jack.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. '),(7,'You Need $100,000 a Year Just to Get by Here','New York’s affordability crisis has worsened since the pandemic, a report finds.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/nyregion/you-need-100000-a-year-just-to-get-by-here.html','Mon, 01 May 2023 04:38:54 +0000','Good morning. We’ll take a look at a troubling report on a problem that affects everyone in New York City — affordability. The phrase “affordability crisis” has become a part of everyday conversation, and no wonder: New York City seems more expensive than ever. Half the households in the city cannot afford to live here. The report detailing that jarring finding, from the Fund for the City of New York, came days after Gov. Kathy Hochul’s ambitious plan for addressing the state’s housing shortage unraveled amid objections from suburban communities on Long Island and in Westchester County. At the same time, the outlook for the city’s economy is increasingly clouded by remote work, with whole floors of Manhattan office buildings vacated by corporate tenants that need less space as more employees do their jobs from home. I talked with my colleague Eliza Shapiro about the affordability crisis and the report from the Fund. This was disturbing but not really surprising, was it? Totally. What the report told us was something that New Yorkers are living with every day, which is that everything about living here has gotten harder except for the megarich. The report showed how hard it is for people to make rent, to comfortably afford housing and buy food, to say nothing of planning for the future or putting money away. This report put hard data and numbers to the reality that people are already living. One thing that jumped out at me was how much the researchers said the affordability crisis is affecting people who do everything you are supposed to do. That’s so profound. They stuck it through during the pandemic, followed the rules and have contributed to the city returning to normal. They’re commuting to work again, yet it’s hard to make the rent and pay the bills. Lisette Nieves, the president of the Fund for the City of New York, said this amounted to a broken contract. That contract, for a long time in New York, meant that if you worked hard and lived reasonably frugally, you could have a comfortable life. New Yorkers and politicians and policymakers have been talking about how hard it is for the middle class to live here. That was a theme of Bill de Blasio’s tenure as mayor, and Eric Adams talks about it a lot. But despite the rhetoric and the commitments, it ’s hard to look back on the last decade and say things are moving in the right direction. One thing in the report that was surprising was that more households are worse off than at the worst of the pandemic. We all thought that New York City was at the nadir during the pandemic, that things couldn’t get worse and that as Covid rates dropped, things would improve. Looking back, what happened was that the federal government created all these social safety net programs that were hugely beneficial — the P.P.P. loans and the stimulus package. All of that has disappeared over the last year. The safety net that the federal government created, which was hugely important for New York during the worst of times two and three years ago — having it go away has left people worse off. The report says you need to take home $100,000 to afford to live in New York — and to eat and afford transportation to work. That’s a lot of money. It also says you need a minimum of $150,000 in parts of Manhattan that have the most expensive ZIP codes in the country. This idea of the six-figure salary has always loomed large as an achievement. To be able to make six figures, that should be a big deal. But we’re finding that in most places in New York City, including the poorest parts of the Bronx, that’s not enough money to live comfortably. You have to bring home well north of six figures to be able to live without worrying about basic expenses. That was a watershed moment, realizing that’s the number we’ve reached. Which means that affordability, or the lack of it, ripples through the life of the city in so many ways. The affordability crisis is changing the city in ways that we don’t yet fully understand. There’s been a significant decline in public school enrollment. We know that people left during the pandemic, but now there’s a sense that people who want to stay in New York — want to stay in the jobs they have here — are moving to the suburbs to have space they can afford for a family. Obviously the decline in public school enrollment is something that senior officials in the Adams administration are really concerned about. If the trend continues, how will they reallocate resources throughout the system? I also think about how much harder it is to be young and on a budget in New York. New York has always been a great place to be young, a great place to move to when you’re just out of college. New York has always been about aspirations. But when everything is so much more expensive — finding a roommate, making the rent, going out to a show, going out to dinner — it’s harder to be young here. I think that raises questions about whether we’ll continue to be a destination for young people. One data point in the report that was striking was that for the majority of families that are struggling, at least one person in the household has at least some college credit or a bachelor’s degree. We’re talking about people who believed that going to college would start them on a secure path in life, and now they’re struggling. That’s why there’s a reckoning in education about the worthiness of everyone going to college when it’s so expensive. And Gov. Kathy Hochul’s a plan to deal with the housing crisis fell apart. I think the failure of the affordable housing push couldn’t come at a worse moment for legislators and government officials. New York’s biggest concern is affordable housing. That’s the nucleus of the affordability crisis, and it doesn’t seem like much is going to change. I expect that we will see increasing pressure on politicians at the city and state levels to take meaningful action to make New York City more affordable for everyone, from low-income families to the upper middle class.

Dear Diary: On an October morning, my girlfriend and I dashed up Fifth Avenue through a bitterly cold and driving rain to the Frick Collection. Our pocket umbrellas did little to protect us. When we arrived, the security guards checked our bags while rainwater puddled at our feet. We were soaked, but the museum was cozy and warm. As we wandered, a guard even agreed to look the other way while we took photos of a beautifully arranged collection of porcelain plates. (She admired them, too.) Afterward, still chilled after our soggy start, we decided to find a nearby lunch spot for a bowl of hot soup. We decided to go to a deli famous for matzo balls that was directly east of where we were and somewhere around Second Avenue. The rain had stopped, but the trees were still full of water. Big heavy drops landed on the sidewalk all around us. As we hurried along 70th Street, an older woman who was walking a dog stopped us. She said she had lived in the neighborhood for decades but had lost her way: Failing eyesight had clouded her sense of direction. Once we helped her get reoriented, she asked where we were headed. “For matzo ball soup off Second Avenue,” we exclaimed. “Why — do you want to go there?” She gasped in alarm. Reorienting us this time, she pointed across the street. “The only place to go is right there,” she said. She may have been losing her eyesight, but she knew her way around a bowl of matzo ball soup. She was right: It was delicious! — Janet Suddell Illustrated by Agnes Lee. Send submissions here and read more Metropolitan Diary here. Glad we could get together here. See you tomorrow. — J.B. P.S.

'),(8,'A Year of Pain: Victims Struggle After Brooklyn Subway Shooting','The rush hour attack killed no one. But every mass shooting has effects that persist unseen.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/brooklyn-subway-shooting-victims.html','Sun, 30 Apr 2023 16:35:25 +0000','More than a year ago, a mass shooting on the subway in Brooklyn miraculously killed no one. But as the victims live on, so do their physical and psychological wounds. No one died when 10 people were shot in the random attack during the morning rush hour, as the train snaked through Sunset Park: A passenger who had been sitting quietly suddenly hurled smoke grenades and brandished a weapon, firing 33 shots. The violence was just one of 648 mass shootings across the United States in 2022, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group. This year has continued on that same dark trajectory: As of Friday, the group had counted at least 172 mass shootings, which it defines as one in which at least four people are killed or injured. There were seven mass shootings on April 15 alone, the highest of any day so far this year. The largest was at a teenager’s birthday party in Alabama, where four were killed and 28 others shot. The resolution of the Brooklyn case was swift: The 63-year-old assailant, who had made a series of rambling videos before the attack, in January pleaded guilty to a firearms offense and 10 counts of terrorist attack in federal court and faces a possible life sentence. But the impact of mass shootings is felt long after they fade from the headlines and is borne by an alarming number of Americans. A recent poll by KFF, a public-health research group, found that more than half of adults said they or a relative had been affected by a gun-related incident, including being threatened or witnessing a shooting. The experiences of victims in the Brooklyn attack illustrate the long-term consequences: the damage not just to bodies, but also to a sense of safety and the ability to earn a living. Rudy Perez, 21, had arrived from Guatemala only about nine months before the attack. He had once hoped to go to college, but going abroad held more economic promise. His family paid about $17,000 to a smuggler who helped him cross the Texas border. He arrived on a Thursday and started working that Monday, at first laying tiles and then assisting an electrician. The morning of the attack, he was headed to a renovation job near Columbus Circle, where he would make about $140 for the day. But his ability to support himself and his family, and to repay that debt, would be severely compromised that morning. At the New Utrecht stop, he immediately noticed the attacker, Frank James, who appeared to have luggage with him, but he didn’t think anything was amiss. Three stops later, the train had filled with riders. Smoke came from under a seat, everything turned gray and the shooting began. “I started to panic,” he said. “I have the sound in my mind.” The train paused before it pulled into 36th Street. Only then did Mr. Perez realize he was bleeding from his skinny calf. A bullet had hit the muscle, missing the bone. He was taken to N.Y.U. Langone Hospital in Brooklyn, where doctors extracted the bullet. Dr. Jonathan Cardwell, who treated him, recalled that he was pale and quiet, in a state of shock. In the months after, he languished. He couldn’t walk and was left with no income. He called offices and lawyers in vain, often unable to communicate. He said that the state Office of Victim Services asked for a Social Security number, which he did not have, and he never received any compensation. He survived on rice, cereal and other basics delivered by a nonprofit, the Center for Family Life. A younger stepsister, who arrived after him and was working as a live-in maid, gave him money for rent. By the summer, he had started working here and there — and venturing out, trying the roller coasters in Coney Island with friends and even the Sunset Park public pool, though he was hesitant to put his leg in. N.Y.U. Langone and the center helped set up therapy sessions where he learned breathing exercises to control anxiety. He did sessions during his lunch breaks. The bullet had missed the bone, and he expects to make a full recovery. A lawyer is helping him file for a special visa for crime victims. He is now working whenever a job is available and thinks he’ll be able to pay off his smuggling debt soon. One simple thing worried him: running. But he was late for his train on a recent morning and found himself sprinting. “From there, I felt I could, and I was happy,” he said. Aroldo Gonzalez’s recovery has been rougher. The 19-year-old American-born son of Guatemalan immigrants was headed to Borough of Manhattan Community College, where he was working toward becoming a police officer. During the attack, a bullet had entered his calf and lodged under his knee. He thinks his favorite footwear, Doc Martens platform boots that make him an inch or so taller, saved his joint. He also had a surface wound on his torso. Doctors at Maimonides Medical Center left the bullet in his leg. But shortly after he returned home, the wound opened again and started gushing blood. He blacked out and received three transfusions at N.Y.U. Langone before surgery to extract the slug. The torso wound became infected and had to be operated on. Doctors said a full recovery would take three years. “I hated the feeling of not being able to walk and having everyone do everything for me,” he said. “Prior to that, I didn’t like asking for help. Now I was forced into taking it.” His injuries impede his progress. He stayed in school, completing his work remotely, but with a reduced course load that delayed his graduation by a semester. He was frustrated that he couldn’t help more over the Easter weekend as he, his mother, Olga Guinea, and his siblings moved into a new apartment. They had spent months searching for a place because he couldn’t make it up and down the stairs in their previous walk-up. He still cannot walk too far and struggles with taking the train. The first time he did so, with his girlfriend, he panicked. They tried to walk the rest of the way, but ended up calling an Uber to go just a few blocks. “I kind of still feel like a burden,” he said. Mass shootings play out for years not just in personal lives of victims, but in the courts. Two lawsuits related to the Sunset Park shooting seek not only to compensate victims but to push for accountability for weapons manufacturers and for increased safety in the subways. Ilene Steur sued Glock, the manufacturer of the gun that Mr. James used, using a new state law allowing such cases. At the moment, the case is on hold as an appeals court weighs the law, which the gun industry argues is unconstitutional. Her lawyers detailed her injuries in June. The bullet entered her backside and went through her abdomen, fracturing her sacrum, said her lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein. She had gone through surgery, needed another operation and had to use a colostomy bag, he said. “Her life will never be the same,” Mr. Rubenstein said. The suit accuses Glock, one of the nation’s largest gunmakers, of marketing its weapons to criminals and failing to stop its products from falling into their hands. It’s the same strategy that lawyers for relatives of Sandy Hook shooting victims used against Remington nearly a decade ago in an attempt to hold the gun industry accountable. Legal experts at first said they had little chance of succeeding, but the case was settled last year for $73 million, in what is believed to be the largest payout by a gun manufacturer in a mass shooting. A suit filed in December against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city by three people who were shot in the Brooklyn attack faults the agencies for failing to ensure safe conditions in the subways. Surveillance cameras at 36th Street and 25th Street were not working at the time of the attack, which complicated the ensuing manhunt. Gov. Kathy Hochul has since vowed to install cameras on every car by 2025. One of the plaintiffs, Houari Benkada, 28, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, suffered a fractured leg and gunshot wound. He’s back to work now as a housekeeping manager at a hotel but continues to grapple with pain and anxiety. “Flashbacks of those events persist,” he said in a statement. “I am still working on trying to get to a better place, like how I was before this happened.” '),(9,'Bryant Park Studios: Luxuny Has Brought the Arts Back to 80 West 40th Street','High above Bryant Park, painting, music, fashion and events are showcased in a quirky historic venue.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/secret-penthouse-artist-studio.html','Sun, 30 Apr 2023 07:00:18 +0000','On a recent Wednesday afternoon, as the sun turned the stained-glass skylight of a Midtown penthouse into a dazzling display of jewel tones, Prosecco was poured into flutes.

In another part of the room, a hat designer was showing off his one-of-a-kind creations, involving emeralds, snakeskin and feathers from Peru. Nearby, a pink-haired painter from Cyprus was explaining her most recent work, hung on the wall behind her. For the past year and a half, Luxuny — the atelier occupying this penthouse high above Bryant Park — has been the setting for various live performances, trunk shows and chef tastings. Part luxury store, part art gallery, part private club, Luxuny is a bit difficult to define. Its founders, K.C. Jones and Luca Santonato, say their mission is to foster a space where “commerce meets culture and community.” That may sound like a 21st-century sensibility, but this particular space, designated a city landmark in 1988 and once called “the most bizarre studio in the city,” has a century-long history of hosting fantastic events — and fascinating people. The building was home to a women-only bar. An artist who might also have been a spy lived upstairs for decades. The penthouse once housed a pipe organ and a stuffed buffalo head. A shimmering fireplace made of onyx and crystals, over five feet tall, has survived to this day. A native of Rimini, a city on the Adriatic coast, Mr. Santonato was looking for a unique space to showcase his custom suit designs, and Ms. Jones, a stylist, pushed him to think beyond a store — and beyond fashion. “We wanted to transmit to our clients the feeling — what we call in Italy la dolce vita,” he said. Walking by 80 West 40th Street, you might notice the spectacular double-height windows. But it’s nearly impossible to imagine what is happening, and all that has happened, inside. The building opened in 1901. Its construction was funded by Col. Abraham Archibald Anderson, who commissioned the architect Charles A. Rich to design a 10-story structure with tall, north-facing windows that would contain space only for artists. Originally called Beaux Arts Studios, it was the first high-rise building of artist studios in New York City. Colonel Anderson, who had studied art in Paris and then married into money, imagined it as a place for artists to live, work and mingle. To describe Colonel Anderson as a portrait painter — Thomas Edison was one of his most famous subjects — doesn’t capture the half of it. He was also an explorer, a rancher, a hunter, the first superintendent of Yellowstone Forest Reserve and eventually, at age 70, a pilot. He took up residence in the penthouse, which he designed himself, and filled the space with paintings, mostly landscapes and portraits (he hated impressionism), as well as an elk head, a pipe organ, an enormous Buddha statue and an ancient suit of armor. A 1929 article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle described Colonel Anderson’s penthouse as “the most bizarre studio in the city.” The reporter detailed unique elements of the penthouse that still exist: the stained-glass dome, the rock crystal fireplace (“brought all the way from an extinct geyser” on the colonel’s Wyoming ranch) and the bathroom, which, with its brass scallop-shell sink and rows of abalone shells, “gives one the feeling of being at the bottom of the cool green ocean.” Sadly, some features of the apartment have been lost over the years. There is no longer a “wide, winding stairway guarded by a writhing, twisting dragon from whose horrible mouth gushes not sparks of fire but water, into a clear little pool, fern-banked and half hidden under the stairs.” Colonel Anderson often entertained in the penthouse, gathering not just artists, but also the rich, international and well-known. One dinner he hosted for the Prince of Monaco included politicians, the industrialist Andrew Carnegie and an admiral in the U.S. Navy. A restaurant and nightclub, the Café des Beaux Arts, occupied the ground floor of 80 West 40th Street when the building, now called Bryant Park Studios, first opened, according to David Seeve, the current property manager. (Mr. Seeve gives tours of its little museum of memorabilia to anyone who is interested.) The cafe was known for its creative crowd — and the women-only bar tucked inside. The movie star and speakeasy maven Texas Guinan sometimes worked there, according to Mr. Seeve. In 1920, the building was leased to L.K. Schwartz Company, an entity that in 1928 tried, and failed, to evict Colonel Anderson. The building survived a fire in 1936. Colonel Anderson died in 1940, and by 1943 the building was sold at auction. But it continued to attract artists. In 1959, a painter named Dorothy Hart Drew moved into the penthouse. Born in Missouri in 1910, Ms. Drew studied art in New York and specialized in portraits. Eleanor Roosevelt, Helen Keller, the actress Lillian Gish and President Herbert Hoover were among her subjects. However, Ms. Drew may have been spying on her fellow artists in the building. In 1957, she testified before Congress, accusing the abstract art movement of harboring “radical elements” and Soviet influence. The year before, she painted a portrait of Representative George Dondero, Republican of Michigan, and some historians concluded that she secretly provided Mr. Dondero with information about fellow artists — some of which he submitted to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1959, Ms. Drew received the Gold Medal of Honor from the American Artists’ Professional League “for courageous and patriotic service to American art.” Other notable tenants of Bryant Park Studios included the photographers Irving Penn and Bert Stern and the painters Florine Stettheimer and Fernand Léger. Mr. Seeve said that, during a deep clean in the 2000s, they found an outgoing letter written by Mr. Penn that had been trapped inside the mail chute since the 1950s. The photographer Edward Steichen had a studio on the ninth floor. The sculptor Jo Davidson, who created the statue of Gertrude Stein that now sits in Bryant Park, also worked in the building. But over the years Bryant Park Studios became more of a commercial space, housing fashion companies and garment district showrooms. By 1991, according to one report, Ms. Drew was the “one artist left” in the building. She died in 1994. Three decades later, art has returned to the penthouse. Paintings, sculpture, suits, shirts, shoes, mirrors, furniture — almost everything a visitor sees in Luxuny is for sale, and almost all of it is customizable. Ms. Jones and Mr. Santonato are romantic partners as well as business partners, and they came up with the concept of Luxuny during the pandemic. He quit a corporate job to pursue men’s wear, and Ms. Jones had been thinking a lot about community and making genuine connections. “I am very business-oriented,” Mr. Santonato said. “She’s like a bomb. She’s like an explosion of ideas.” Creating a store that’s more than a store may sound like esoteric gibberish until it is experienced — the International Brazilian Opera Company performing in front of bespoke suits, or a “reverse dinner party” in which the appetizer looks like dessert (cannoli, but stuffed with crab) and the dessert looks like a first course (a tortellini soup, but the pasta is filled with chocolate and the broth is pear and apple juice). A bit bizarre, just as the colonel would have wanted. Future events include a play about the penthouse, a panel talk on empowering women, and possibly a private client “build your own suit” event with an international bank. “I design my own line of bespoke garments,” Mr. Santonato, 41, said, “but I’m not the first one doing this, and I’m not going to be the last one doing this.” The difference he offers is the unique atmosphere inside a historic space. Ms. Jones, 36, said that they were “still tweaking” the concept, and compared it to making spaghetti: “Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks.” But she spoke with reverence about the first time she walked into the vestibule of the penthouse and saw the tiny hand-laid tiles on the floor. “I was like, Oooh. OK. I’m at home,” she said. When she learned the history of the building — and specifically the top floor — she was even more sure. She felt, she said, “like stars aligned.” '),(10,'Gov. Hochul Severs Ties With Top Political Adviser in Face of Backlash','Gov. Kathy Hochul and the adviser, Adam Sullivan, agreed that he should step down after The New York Times detailed how his guidance and behavior were questioned by others.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/adam-sullivan-resignation-hochul.html','Sun, 30 Apr 2023 23:46:19 +0000','A top political adviser to Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York abruptly informed colleagues that he would resign on Sunday, citing a New York Times report that called into question his political counsel and described a toxic work environment under him. The adviser, Adam C. Sullivan, was not a state government employee but had been the de facto head of Ms. Hochul’s political operation, as well as a trusted and well-compensated confidant for more than a decade. He oversaw her 2022 campaign from his home in Colorado, and she had deputized him to help steer the beleaguered state Democratic Party. In an email Sunday to colleagues, including the state party chairman, Mr. Sullivan apologized for behavior that included belittling and marginalizing his subordinates and said he and the governor agreed he should relinquish his responsibilities “for the foreseeable future.” “In retrospect, I can see the toll that the campaign took on me,” he wrote in the email, sent just after 5 p.m. “And after some serious thinking, I think it best if I take some time away from politics and the campaign environment and get healthy.” Ms. Hochul, a Democrat who had praised Mr. Sullivan just last week, confirmed his resignation in a separate brief statement. She did not elaborate on who might fill his place, and Mr. Sullivan did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. “I was disappointed by what was described in The New York Times story about Adam, and he and I agreed that he should step back,” Ms. Hochul said. The departure comes at a politically fraught time for the governor, as she is putting the final touches on a $229 billion state budget that is a month overdue. Questions about Mr. Sullivan’s political acumen and treatment of other Hochul aides had become a distraction in Albany in recent days, with labor leaders, lawmakers and lobbyists questioning how Ms. Hochul could continue relying on him. Some fellow Democrats said on Sunday said that Ms. Hochul had made the right decision. “Given that nobody knew what Mr. Sullivan was responsible for, perhaps his departure will add clarity to her organizational chart,” said Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democratic state senator from Manhattan. “Governor Hochul has a strong team on the second floor. This will improve the lines of communication between the governor and the Legislature.” A friend and adviser to Ms. Hochul since her 2011 special election to Congress, Mr. Sullivan, 42, amassed considerable influence after she unexpectedly became governor in August 2021. He helped build her administration, oversaw her widely criticized campaign for a full term and recently took a more active role with the state party. During the campaign, he pushed back against other advisers who wanted to see Ms. Hochul more actively address fears about crime — a potent line of attack used by Republicans. Mr. Sullivan argued that crime was a losing issue for a Democratic governor, and advised Ms. Hochul to stay focused on abortion rights, an issue he believed would motivate voters. Ms. Hochul narrowly won, but national Democrats have blamed her approach for costing House seats in New York. Ms. Hochul does have other important advisers who have played a role in building her political team, including Karen Persichilli Keogh, her top government aide, and Jefrey Pollock, her longtime pollster. But none played quite the role Mr. Sullivan did. Without a defined job title and no social media profile, Mr. Sullivan operated largely out of public view from his home 1,700 miles away in Leadville, Colo. He had few relationships with important political actors in the state and even his generous compensation was murky. Ms. Hochul’s campaign reported paying $50,000 since 2021 to a limited liability company that Mr. Sullivan controls, “ACS Campaign Consulting.” But The Times found that he had earned $500,000 or more in a secretive arrangement where he received a portion of what the campaign spent on TV ads. Mr. Sullivan also faced dissent from within Ms. Hochul’s campaign team and the executive chamber. The Times’s report cited more than 15 colleagues who said that Mr. Sullivan had disparaged subordinates, especially young women, froze out aides who disagreed with him and often shifted blame to others when the campaign faltered. The aides and advisers who spoke to The Times all requested anonymity for fear of retribution, but said they believed Mr. Sullivan was pulling down Ms. Hochul’s political standing. In his email on Sunday, Mr. Sullivan apologized “to anyone who felt harmed in any way by my behavior.” He also suggested the break would be permanent. Ms. Hochul would govern “without me interfering in any way,” he said. “I look forward to watching her success from afar.” '),(11,'Peter Gelb and Keri-Lynn Wilson’s Sunday Routine','After tennis, swimming and some time in the sauna, Peter Gelb and Keri-Lynn Wilson work at their adjoining desks.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/nyregion/peter-gelb-keri-lynn-wilson.html','Sun, 30 Apr 2023 13:46:30 +0000','Married for 19 years, Keri-Lynn Wilson and Peter Gelb spend a lot of time apart because of their high-profile careers. Ms. Wilson, 55, is a conductor with gigs all over the world. Mr. Gelb, 69, is the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. Even when they are together on the occasional Sunday, work has a way of interfering: While Ms. Wilson prepares for her next maestro engagement, Mr. Gelb is on call for whatever needs doing at the Met, including scrambling to find a replacement if a singer cancels just before a matinee. Sometimes they collaborate: They are currently working on a concert tour of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra. Ms. Wilson, who will conduct, had the idea for the performances after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. What follows is a typical weekend for the couple when they are both at home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where they live in a duplex, blocks away from the Met. SOPHISTICATED AND LUXURIOUS Mr. Gelb: I get up between 6 and 6:30. My wife is still sleeping at that point, so I pad down the stairs and start my morning off with a cappuccino with two shots of espresso and skim milk. I have a banana and a vitamin C energy drink, and then I do some early morning phone calls to European colleagues who are awake, answer some of last night’s emails and check the box office report. Ms. Wilson: I typically get up around 7:30. I try to get a good night’s rest. For 25 years, my career has meant living out of suitcases and hotels. If I’ve been on the road a bit, sometimes I confuse the hot and cold taps in the apartment. SCORES, ON AND OFF THE COURT Mr. Gelb: I usually get an Uber to make sure I catch the 8:20 tram to Roosevelt Island in time for my 8:30-to-10 tennis match at the Roosevelt Island Racquet Club. On my way to tennis I always send Keri-Lynn messages wishing her a good morning. She’s the only person in the world I send emojis to. Ms. Wilson: I came to New York when I was 18 to go to Juilliard. New York has always been special to me. But unfortunately when I’m here I’m usually sitting at my desk with a score. I’ll have my coffee, watch BBC News, have my breakfast of fruit and cereal and yogurt, and then I’ll go right to work. WATER IN THE BASEMENT Mr. Gelb: By the time I get back to the apartment, Keri-Lynn is doing her daily routine of 30 minutes of swimming. Ms. Wilson: Every single day I swim. We live in a very old building, and the swimming pool in the basement was a major factor in our decision to live here. As a conductor, my body is my machine. Mr. Gelb: It’s an ancient lap pool. In the early 20th century, Isadora Duncan used the area it’s in to rehearse with her dancers. HOT AND COLD Mr. Gelb: We meet for our first communal activity of the day, a sauna and a steam. We have a sauna and a separate steam room in the apartment. Ms. Wilson: I would add that I’m part Icelandic, and there’s a great Scandinavian tradition of heat contrasted with ice-cold. We always finish with a super cold shower. Mr. Gelb: Then we have a very light lunch, sort of on the fly. Ms. Wilson: We’ll have a hard-boiled egg. We don’t even sit down. We’ll stand at our tall counter. Then I get back to my desk. COLLABORATING Mr. Gelb: We have next to the kitchen a long, narrow office with two adjoining desks. Usually we’re both in there working. In the case of a project like the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra, I fill in Keri-Lynn on dates that have come in from our organizers, and she’ll tell me about the repertoire she’s planning. Ms. Wilson: Putting together a project like this with Peter, who is so brilliant, it wasn’t even daunting. It doesn’t even feel like work. PIANO ESCAPE Mr. Gelb: We have a music room that has a Steinway baby concert grand, where she also studies her scores. Ms. Wilson: When Peter gets on the phone, that’s where I escape. THE WORK Mr. Gelb: Some Sundays, there’s a matinee. If it starts at 3, I’ll get there around 2:30 to say hello to the artists and the conductor. And if there are any important patrons to say hello to, I will do that. If I’ve seen the performance several times already, I will go in and out of my office, about 50 yards away from a secret entrance to the general manager’s box. Ms. Wilson: While Peter’s at the matinee, I will still be at my desk. I have perfect pitch, so I can look at a page and hear the notes in my head without having to play them. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time to read through a score. Just once takes several hours. And then you keep going through it. There’s so many aspects you have to understand: the structure, the dynamics, the phrasing. SANCTUARY Ms. Wilson: I will finally get away to walk in Central Park, my sanctuary. As much as I like to think I’m relaxing, I’m still studying music. Sometimes I’m listening on my headphones, sometimes I just think about it. I adore looking at Sheep Meadow, that skyline. Many times I’ll record a video message for my cousin in Ukraine. I speak a lot of languages, but I feel very insecure that I don’t speak Ukrainian fluently yet. My best friend who taught me Russian is teaching me Ukrainian. DINNER FOR TWO Mr. Gelb: I’m the cook. I’ll make fish and vegetables, with the fish probably from Citarella. It’s healthy, too healthy. If I’m craving pasta, I’ll make something for Keri-Lynn and I might make myself spaghetti with clam sauce. Ms. Wilson: Like I said, I treat my body like a machine. I feel like I have more energy if I avoid pasta. While Peter’s doing his dinner prep, I like to play the piano. COCKTAIL HOUR Ms. Wilson: Once he’s prepped, I like to say, “Peter, can we sit down and have a cocktail?” Mr. Gelb: Keri-Lynn will have a glass of Champagne. I like to have iced vodka. COMPETITION Mr. Gelb: We might play Scrabble, too. I think I have a larger English vocabulary than she does, but she’s a much more talented Scrabble player. Ms. Wilson: I’ve occasionally ended up getting a word worth 98 points. Mr. Gelb: I find that very demoralizing. ROLL INTO BED Mr. Gelb: I’m in bed by 11:30, midnight at the latest. Ms. Wilson: I go to bed a little later, maybe 1 or so. I have a wonderful physical therapist who showed me how ballerinas use rollers to stretch out their back muscles. You can use the roller in other ways, too, for all sorts of core exercises. I like to spend 15 minutes doing that before bed. It’s like an extra little workout.

I was about ﬁve months pregnant at the time. As we walked, we passed two women sitting on folding chairs outside a psychic’s storefront with a table of cards and candles between them. “August,” one of them said, pointing at my belly. We continued walking. “A boy, right?” the other shouted. I turned around and nodded exuberantly. “Well, you would know!” I shouted back. — Emily Toder Dear Diary: On an October morning, my girlfriend and I dashed up Fifth Avenue through a bitterly cold and driving rain to the Frick Collection. Our pocket umbrellas did little to protect us. When we arrived, the security guards checked our bags while rainwater puddled at our feet. We were soaked, but the museum was cozy and warm. As we wandered, a guard even agreed to look the other way while we took photos of a beautifully arranged collection of porcelain plates. (She admired them, too.) Afterward, still chilled after our soggy start, we decided to find a nearby lunch spot for a bowl of hot soup. We decided to go to a deli famous for matzo balls that was directly east of where we were and somewhere around Second Avenue. The rain had stopped, but the trees were still full of water. Big heavy drops landed on the sidewalk all around us. As we hurried along 70th Street, an older woman who was walking a dog stopped us. She said she had lived in the neighborhood for decades but had lost her way: Failing eyesight had clouded her sense of direction. Once we helped her get reoriented, she asked where we were headed. “For matzo ball soup off Second Avenue,” we exclaimed. “Why — do you want to go there?” She gasped in alarm. Reorienting us this time, she pointed across the street. “The only place to go is right there,” she said. She may have been losing her eyesight, but she knew her way around a bowl of matzo ball soup. She was right: It was delicious! — Janet Suddell Dear Diary: It was a warm spring evening in 2019. My boyfriend and I were walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park with another couple after dinner. As we came around a bend, I heard the song “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers coming from a small party of picnickers. Whenever I hear the song, it stops me in my tracks and I am filled with emotion as I was that evening. A man with the picnic group approached us and asked whether I was OK. I told him that “Lovely Day” had been my husband’s “theme song” when he was sick and that we had played it at his funeral. The man took my hand, introduced me to the rest of his party and told his friends about my history with the song. Suddenly, we were all dancing, hugging and singing along. — Jan Testori-Markman Dear Diary: It was late September 2019. I was walking in East River Park on my way to the East Village. I had on a white and gold Kerala sari that I had worn for an event at my children’s school near Kips Bay. Despite New Yorkers’ well-earned reputation for not batting an eye at other people’s outfits, I had gotten quite a few thumbs-ups and double takes for mine. I smiled, acknowledged them all and walked on toward my destination, East 10th Street and Avenue A. As I paused to cross at 10th Street and Avenue C, I heard a woman calling out to me. I turned to see a South Asian woman in her late 40s or early 50s running toward me and waving for me to stop. “Is that a Kerala sari?” she asked, panting a bit. “Yes,” I replied, smiling. “You must think I’m crazy,” she said, “but I’ve lived in this city for 35 years, and I’ve never seen someone in a Kerala sari just walking down the street.” “I moved here from Kerala in ’84,” she continued. “My mom passed away last year, and now I own all her saris. I’ve never worn them but seeing you walk down the street is my mom giving me a sign. May I give you a hug?” We hugged right there at the corner of 10th and C. With teary eyes, she wished me a good day, and we went our separate ways. — Shweta Ganesh Kumar Dear Diary: While strolling through SoHo, I stopped at a popular deli for lunch. As the waiter approached with a pitcher of ice water, I shook my head and asked for bottled water. “For some reason, the tap water doesn’t agree with me,” I said. He looked at me for a long moment before answering. “About what?” he said. — Joan DelFattore Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

'),(13,'Stud Country, a Queer Line Dancing and Two-Step Class, Makes a Return to New York','Stud Country, a queer line dancing and two-step class from Los Angeles, made a rollicking return to New York on a recent Monday.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/style/stud-country-line-dancing-two-step-class.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:00:40 +0000','On the night of April 17, a crowd of 20- and 30-somethings, many of them queer, packed into Georgia Room, a Georgia O’Keeffe-inspired nightclub at the Freehand Hotel in Manhattan. They were there to drink and dance, but they hadn’t paid $25 each to grind or freestyle. They came to line dance. More than 300 people — some in cowboy boots and 10-gallon hats and biceps-exposing denim vests — turned out for the sold-out event. And this was on a Monday. The evening’s draw was Stud Country, a queer line-dancing and two-step class and party that usually takes place in Los Angeles. There, the event draws regulars and curious newcomers every Monday and Thursday to Club Bahia, a Latin joint in Echo Park. Sean Monaghan, 35, and Bailey Salisbury, 38, friends of nearly two decades, founded Stud Country in 2021, after the pandemic forced the closure of Oil Can Harry’s, a gay honky-tonk bar where they had been line dancing since 2017.  To keep that community alive during the Covid-19 lockdowns, Mr. Monaghan, a former competitive Irish dancer from the Bay Area, and Ms. Salisbury, a competitive jazz lyrical dancer in high school, began hosting line dancing events over Zoom. The events later migrated to improvised spaces like parking lots and, eventually, bars; they landed at Club Bahia in October 2022. At around 8:30 p.m., Mr. Monaghan, in a camo vest and a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “No Fear,” and Ms. Salisbury, in a rhinestone-studded red bra top and matching red pants, stepped onto a rug-covered stage to lay out the ground rules. “No drinks on the dance floor,” Mr. Monaghan said into his mic. “And the dance floor is for dancing.” For the next hour, complying proved complicated, in part because of the size of the crowd. Leaving the dance floor practically meant standing on a couch that had been pushed against a wall.  Ms. Salisbury, irrepressibly upbeat and genial off the stage, moves like a tumbler on it, bounding and bouncing, tossing her pin-straight hair and grinning as she calls out her steps. Mr. Monaghan, the straight gay man to her sprite, takes a more understated — if equally impressive — approach, flowing from move to move with grace and ease.  After the D.J. spun the first song, “Texas Time” by Keith Urban, it was teaching time. The students, massed shoulder to shoulder, followed Mr. Monaghan and Ms. Salisbury’s directions, edging side to side and pivoting from stage to windows to bar. Attendees then split into two groups, one watching while the other performed to music. Next came two-step partner dancing, which doubled as a reminder that 300 moving bodies generate serious heat. Sweat arced through the air. Hands fanned at slick, focused faces. At around 10 p.m., someone cracked the windows and a breeze cooled the room. The music throughout the night was eclectic. At Stud Country, Britney Spears lives one turn off Steve Earle’s “Copperhead Road,” and Deana Carter sips “Strawberry Wine” with Ed Sheeran and Juice Newton. Not everyone donned their country-western best. Many wore one or two on-theme pieces, some none. Unlike the bluejeans and belt buckles, though, the boots matter. “The leather soles help you twist and slide,” Ms. Salisbury said. Even so, Ming Lin, 34, an archivist from Lower Manhattan, wasn’t ready to make the investment. “I don’t feel that I’ve earned them,” she said. Joel Dean, 36, an artist in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens, said he first attended Stud Country in late 2021, when the event came to Georgia Room for four dates. He fell head over boot heels in love with line dancing and, with his friends Bronwen Lam, a writer, and Tenaya Kelleher, a choreographer, founded a semiregular class inspired by Stud Country at Ukrainian East Village Restaurant. “I did get the boots,” said Mr. Dean, who was seated next to Ms. Lin. “I earned them.” Asked why so many queer people seem drawn to Stud Country, Ray Lipstein, a 31-year-old Brooklyn resident, observed that compared with other styles of dance, this take on line dancing “wears its euphoria closer to the surface.”  Line dancing has inspired queer dancers for decades. The International Association of Gay/Lesbian Country Western Dance Clubs was founded in 1993. In Manhattan, Big Apple Ranch, a country-western dance class taught on the second Saturday of every month, has been going since 1997. As the night progressed and the crowd thinned, experienced dancers remained on the floor for more advanced routines. It was easy to understand why Stud Country, which will return to Georgia Room during June’s Pride celebrations and Lincoln Center on June 23, calls itself the “Queer Church of Line Dance.” Arrayed in a loose, squirming circle around the adepts, onlookers wore expressions of good-natured awe. They hooted. They hollered. They did not gawk ironically. “It’s shared consciousness, abandonment, surrender into synchronicity,” Ms. Salisbury said earlier in the day.  Or, as Mr. Monaghan said from the stage: “It’s a holy thing you do with people.” '),(14,'George Santos, Instead of Shrinking From the Spotlight, Steps Into It','Mr. Santos seems to be testing whether his notoriety will translate into a form of celebrity, if not eventual acceptance.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/nyregion/george-santos-washington.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 16:22:08 +0000','WASHINGTON — As he strode into a bar packed with margarita-sipping young Republicans here the other night, Representative George Santos of New York looked like a man who had finally gotten what he had always wanted. Nevermind the conspicuous giggling or an introducer’s reference to “bipartisan condemnation” that he has inspired. It was a glorious spring night in the capital, and for eight minutes, Mr. Santos had something rare: an invitation to speak. Standing behind a high-top, he roasted Don Lemon, the former CNN anchor who was recently fired, and offered advice about running for office. “I didn’t wait my turn,” he said, adding an expletive. He added that Covid made people pick “stupid presidents,” and declared, with no apparent sense of irony, that “the truth will set you free.” But he knew what would give his audience the biggest rise. “I’m not going anywhere,” he declared. “You’re going to have to drag my dead, cold body out of this institution.” Four months after his whole concocted biography unraveled — one Wall Street job and collegiate volleyball championship at a time — Mr. Santos remains a pariah. Colleagues refuse to work with him, dooming his legislative priorities. His local party has vowed to defeat him. And a slew of law enforcement and ethics investigators are combing through his life and campaign finances. But rather than shrinking from the attention, the 34-year-old congressman is stepping ever more definitely toward the spotlight. Mr. Santos seems eager to test whether he can make the journey from laughingstock to legitimacy by aligning himself with former President Donald J. Trump — or at least signaling that he’s in on the joke. In just the last few weeks, he showed up outside the Manhattan courthouse where Mr. Trump was being arraigned, making himself, in a pair of oversized dark sunglasses, a brief sideshow for a mob of reporters. He’s laughed gamely as a Trump impressionist filming outside the U.S. Capitol pretended to choose him, George Santos, as his vice-presidential running mate. And on Wednesday, he forced his colleagues to watch and listen as he withheld his support for a major Republican debt limit bill, finally committing his vote just after the clock ran out. If it is an unorthodox, and perhaps still futile path, Mr. Santos has few other options. He serves on no House committees. His local Republican Party has banned him from its events, and pushed other civic organizations to blackball him, too. The invitation by the Washington, D.C., Young Republicans was his first time on the capital speaking circuit. Mr. Santos insists this is all a good thing, leaving him more time to speak directly to constituents who he says will re-elect him next year, to introduce bills — 11 to date — and to draw attention to them in speeches on the House floor. But in an institution that requires cooperation to get anything done, he is stuck in a vacuum. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the dean of New York’s congressional delegation, has barred him from regular, bipartisan meetings to discuss the state’s priorities. Representatives for New York’s senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, said he has yet to seek to work with them. And while House leaders navigating a razor-thin majority have stopped short of calling for his expulsion, colleagues say they have made clear they will only tolerate so much. “I have no doubt that he will be a one-term congressman,” said Representative Anthony D’Esposito, a fellow New York Republican who, like Mr. Santos, flipped a Democratic-leaning suburban district on Long Island last November. Mr. D’Esposito said he had gone out of his way to make sure his name did not appear on letters or bills with Mr. Santos, and bemoaned the constant churn that seemed to follow his colleague, and overshadow his own work. “He’s looking for life after this short stint on Capitol Hill,” Mr. D’Esposito said. Risa Heller, a Democrat and public relations guru who advises big-name clients in unsavory situations, said it was not impossible for Mr. Santos to entertain thoughts of re-election. “We live in a world where literally a reality TV star became president of the United States” she said. But then again, a future on reality TV may be more realistic, she added. “Could he get a job on ‘Dancing With the Stars’? Probably. ‘Survivor’? ‘Big Brother 2024’? That all seems like a plausible option,” she said. For now, Mr. Santos at least puts on the appearance of enjoying life on Capitol Hill. “I came here to represent the people, and I don’t dislike it. I genuinely don’t,” he said in an impromptu interview before stepping into an elevator outside his office. He was hoping to plunge down into the Capitol’s subterranean tunnels, but instead the elevator shot up, giving him time for several minutes of banter. He lamented being trapped with a reporter (“that, I guarantee you, I don’t want to do”), cast a look at a woman speaking loudly into a cellphone, and when a fellow passenger complimented his pink silk tie, he tried a joke. It did not land. “Look, it’s going to sound silly. It’s pop culture. It’s really bad,” the congressman started to explain. “Remember ‘Mean Girls,’ the movie? They would make the joke, ‘on Wednesdays, we wear pink.’” Finally in the basement, Mr. Santos said reverently that he never talked about politics in the Capitol. He then proceeded to answer some questions about politics. No, he said, he was not concerned about the vow by Nassau County Republicans, who backed his 2020 and 2022 campaigns, to defeat him. Nor did he need to reintroduce himself to voters, though he quickly thought better of an offer to tour the district with a reporter. And rumors aside, he said he had never considered quitting. “I live in the district. I’m a constituent of the district. I know the people. I eat in the district. I shop in the district. Folks know me. They call me,” he said, adding: “The reality is, trying to paint me as a boogeyman isn’t going to work.” Local Republicans dispute that he is a meaningful presence, outside of the occasional tour of a Coast Guard facility or veterans hospital. This week, Mr. Santos’s official House calendar showed no upcoming events. “A ghost!” Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, wrote in a text. At the one event he did show up to in Washington this week, the dozens of Hill aides and America First-aligned young professionals who turned out seemed torn over whether Mr. Santos could be repackaged as a principled conservative or was doomed to remain a political circus act. “Traditionally, Republicans when they get caught doing something with their pants down, they have to apologize and resign, so that brazenness of saying ‘I’m going to stick it out, I’m going to fight,’ I think we respect that mentality,” said Kingsley Cortes, a former Trump campaign aide, adding that she was impressed by Mr. Santos’s conservative voting record. But then again, Ms. Cortes, who helped lead a “MAGA takeover” of the club earlier this year, acknowledged that the invitation to the congressman would also goose attendance. “We want to be a place that creates buzz and draws people in,” she added. “Seeing someone like George Santos is exciting for a lot of people. You see skits about him on S.N.L. He’s talked about constantly.” At times in his eight-minute speech, Mr. Santos seemed just as torn — and perhaps even contrite. “I’m faulty, I’ve made mistakes. All of you have made mistakes,” he said, skipping over details of his own. “The truth will set you free. True statement — very, very true statement.” Later, as he was skewering Mr. Lemon as a liar, Mr. Santos again turned the lens on himself. “It’s just so easy to point fingers, so easy to be a jackass in life,” he said. “And then, when it happens to you, you expect, you know, people to be sincere.” He paused to rib another journalist in the room, then added: “The reality is you just have to take this life and live it.” '),(15,'Rape Case Places Trump in Legal Jeopardy. Politically, He’s Thriving.','The former president’s new campaign is rolling unimpeded under the spotlights. In quiet courtrooms, he faces more serious threats.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/nyregion/trump-carroll-rape-case-election.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 22:16:04 +0000','During E. Jean Carroll’s first day on the witness stand, her lawyer asked what had brought her to a federal courtroom in Manhattan. “I am here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen,” Ms. Carroll replied. “He lied and shattered my reputation, and I am here to try to get my life back.” A day later, Mr. Trump, who has denied the attack and called Ms. Carroll a liar, campaigned in New Hampshire, joking to a crowd about his changing nicknames for Hillary Clinton and President Biden. He did not mention Ms. Carroll’s testimony, or the civil trial going on 250 miles away. But he remarked cheerfully on a poll released that day, which showed him far and away leading the 2024 Republican primary field. Since Mr. Trump was indicted last month in a criminal case brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, his legal travails and his third presidential campaign have played out on a split screen. The courtroom dramas have taken place without news cameras present, even as the race has returned Mr. Trump to the spotlight that briefly dimmed after he left the Oval Office. Ms. Carroll’s harrowing testimony, a visceral demonstration of Mr. Trump’s legal peril, has emphasized the surreal nature of the divide. Mr. Trump is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. But he has also been indicted on 34 felony false records charges, and in Ms. Carroll’s case faces a nine-person jury that will determine whether he committed rape decades ago. And then there are the other investigations: for election interference, mishandling sensitive documents and his role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol. “To see a former and potential future president of the United States confront all these legal issues at once is bizarre,” said Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party and a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump. “But what’s really disturbing about it is that he’s the front-runner for a major political party in this country. And you can’t just blame that on him. You have to blame that on the leaders of the party and their primary base.” The past week brought the former president a steady stream of setbacks. Ms. Carroll gave detailed and graphic testimony about the encounter with Mr. Trump. The judge in the case sought to limit Mr. Trump’s posts on social media, as did the Manhattan district attorney’s office in its own case. And former Vice President Mike Pence testified before a grand jury hearing evidence about Mr. Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Mike Murphy, a Republican political strategist who advised John McCain and Jeb Bush, said that trials and investigations of Mr. Trump often create “a psychological roller coaster for Trump-hating Democrats,” giving them hope that he will be taken down, only to leave them disappointed. Mr. Trump’s legal problems have yet to create significant political problems given the unflinching loyalty of his core supporters. Since Mr. Trump was indicted, his poll numbers have risen. Criminal investigations against him, in Georgia and Washington, as well as Ms. Carroll’s trial and a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general’s office, have done little to hamper him with his supporters. The poll he mentioned Thursday predicted that he would receive 62 percent of the vote in the Republican primary. His closest opponent, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has not yet declared that he is running, was polling at 16 percent. But the investigations could cause Mr. Trump real harm. If he is convicted in Manhattan, where he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, he could face up to four years in prison. Criminal charges in Georgia and Washington could come with steeper punishments. And the New York attorney general’s lawsuit against him — which accused him of deceiving lenders and insurers by fraudulently overvaluing his assets — could exact a heavy financial toll. No matter the outcome, any direct connection between Mr. Trump’s legal fate in the rape case and his political fortunes is tenuous. But Ms. Carroll’s lawyers have reshaped a political bombshell from 2016 into a potent legal weapon: They plan to use the “Access Hollywood” tape on which Mr. Trump boasts about grabbing women by the genitals as the basis for a compelling story about a self-styled playboy man-about-town whose modus operandi was assaulting women. Mr. Trump said on the tape that “when you’re a star, they let you do it.” When the comments became public during the 2016 election, Mr. Trump characterized them as “locker room banter” and after his victory, they became an example of his apparent immunity to scandal. In the courtroom, which Mr. Trump has avoided, Ms. Carroll’s team argued that his words were not to be dismissed, even years after they became public. “This was not locker room talk,” Shawn G. Crowley, one of her lawyers, said on the first day of the trial. “It’s exactly what he did to Ms. Carroll and to other women.” Those other women, named by Ms. Crowley as Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, are expected to testify for Ms. Carroll. Ms. Carroll described for the jury how a chance meeting with Mr. Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman store in New York City in the mid-1990s turned into an encounter that would haunt her for nearly 30 years. The assault, she said, took place in a sixth-floor dressing room. After Mr. Trump shut the door, she said, he shoved her against the wall hard enough that she hit her head. He put his mouth against hers, Ms. Carroll said, pulled down her tights, put his fingers inside of her vagina and then his penis.  Ms. Carroll testified that she has been unable to have sex or a romantic relationship since. “I am a happy person basically, but I’m aware that I have lost out on one of the glorious experiences of any human being,” she said. “Being in love with somebody else, making dinner with them, walking the dog together. I don’t have that.” On Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Joseph Tacopina, began cross-examining Ms. Carroll. He sought to highlight her memory lapses — most prominently her inability to provide the date of the alleged rape — and to elicit testimony that he suggested showed the jury how implausible the story seemed. He noted that Ms. Carroll herself had written in her 2019 memoir, where she first told her story, that some of the details were “odd” and “inconceivable.” “It all comes down to: Do you believe the unbelievable?” Mr. Tacopina said during his opening statement. The jurors, six men and three women, will decide whether Ms. Carroll proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Trump committed the assault. Because the trial is civil, he would face monetary damages rather than a conviction. Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit also seeks a retraction of what the suit says were defamatory comments on his Truth Social website last October, when he called her case “a complete con job” and “a Hoax and a lie.” The social platform is one of Mr. Trump’s most potent political tools. And the legal cases are threatening his ability to use it unhindered. On Tuesday, a prosecutor working for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, asked the state judge in the false business records criminal case to limit Mr. Trump from disseminating evidence online, including on that platform. And on Wednesday, after the former president made Truth Social posts calling Ms. Carroll’s allegation a “made up SCAM” and a “fraudulent & false story,” the federal judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, said they were “entirely inappropriate” and suggested the former president was attempting to influence the jury. When, hours later, Judge Kaplan was told by Ms. Carroll’s lawyer that Mr. Trump’s son Eric had tweeted an attack on Ms. Carroll’s case, the judge sternly suggested the former president might face criminal sanction. “If I were in your shoes,” Judge Kaplan told Mr. Tacopina, “I’d be having a conversation with the client.” '),(16,'New York Will Toughen Contentious Bail Law to Give Judges More Discretion','State leaders agree to eliminate a provision that requires judges to prescribe the “least restrictive” means to ensure defendants return to court.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/bail-reform-ny.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 02:33:36 +0000','ALBANY, N.Y. — It was just four years ago that New York’s Democratic lawmakers celebrated a new law that eliminated bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies and, at the time, seemingly added a measure of new justice to a system long faulted for pre-emptively punishing the poor. On Thursday night, however, after months of grueling negotiations, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state would scale back those changes — for the third time — after a sharp rebuke from New York’s voters and residents over a rise in crime. “It was very clear that changes need to be made,” the governor said. The precise details are unknown — the law is still being drafted as part of the state budget that is expected to be ratified next week — but Ms. Hochul said that she and the Legislature intend to eliminate a provision that requires judges to prescribe the “least restrictive” means to ensure defendants return to court. While judges will remain unable to set bail for a vast majority of misdemeanor and nonviolent charges, such a change could nonetheless have a dramatic impact, giving judges greater discretion to hold defendants — particularly repeat or serious offenders — before their trials. A recent Siena College poll found overwhelming support for changes to the state’s bail laws, with more than 70 percent saying judges should have greater leeway in setting bail for defendants accused of serious crimes. Only 20 percent opposed that idea. Some efforts to modify bail laws have been derailed even in safely Democratic states like California, where lawmakers overhauled the system in 2018 but failed to pass additional changes last year. Leniency on bail has also become an issue in several recent races for governor, including in Michigan, Colorado and Illinois, where a law ending cash bail, scheduled to take effect in January, is being challenged in the state’s Supreme Court. The changes outlined by Ms. Hochul were backed by law enforcement officials and prosecutors, including the state district attorneys association, whose president hailed the potential changes on Friday as a victory for public safety. The governor’s office on Friday pointed to a pair of recent incidents — including the choking death of a 15-year-old and an attempted murder — in which the judge cited the “least restrictive” standard in permitting the pretrial release of defendants. The coming bill is likely to include new language asking judges to instead consider the “kind or degree of control or restriction necessary” to get defendants to return to court. How prosecutors would use the new bail standards is difficult to predict, as is whether a lower threshold for imposing bail would result in lower rates of crime. But on Friday, opponents of the change were already suggesting that Ms. Hochul’s plan seemed more like that of a hardened conservative than a freshly elected Democrat. “She stripped the rights and safety of marginalized communities — no different than what is happening in G.O.P.-held states across the country,” said Jawanza J. Williams, the director of organizing for VOCAL-NY, an activist group that works to lessen mass incarceration. “If this was her flexing her control of the statehouse, it completely backfired, and constituents are left to pick up the pieces with little hope for progress. Shame on Governor Hochul.” Still, the proposed changes come after several years — and electoral cycles — in which Ms. Hochul and other Democrats were battered politically over violent crime and faced calls for the state to change the bail laws to better ensure public safety. Last fall, Democrats underperformed expectations in several statewide races and lost four House seats to Republicans, mostly in suburban areas where crime remains a motivating issue. Ms. Hochul herself narrowly won a full term over her Republican challenger, Lee M. Zeldin, who campaigned on law and order. She signaled her desire for changes during her State of the State message in January, suggesting “clarifying bail laws.” Whether the changes the governor is proposing will result in more detainees’ immediately spending more time in county jails is unclear. But a change to the “kind or degree of control or restriction necessary” language would be a return to the language that was in place before the 2019 overhaul, said Michael Rempel, director of Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Mr. Rempel believes that even if that language holds, it is unlikely to significantly change the way bail is set across the state. However, “at the margins, some judges may use this somewhat less clear language to set bail in cases where they would not have previously,” he said. Jullian Harris-Calvin, a program director with the Vera Institute of Justice, a group that works to reform criminal justice systems, noted that judges already have a raft of tools at their disposal to compel defendants to return to court — including curfews, daily check-ins and electronic monitoring — that are less disruptive than jail. “The judge can really, for the most part, come up with conditions that they think this person needs to comply with in order to remain stable,” she said. In remarks at the State Capitol on Thursday night, Ms. Hochul insisted that “overall bail reform was needed,” arguing that “no one, regardless of money, should be incarcerated because they don’t have enough.” But she said she was motivated by increases in recidivism for some serious crimes, citing data from the State Division of Criminal Justice Services, as well as her belief that “judges should have more authority to set bail and detain dangerous defendants.” Proponents of the 2019 law argue that studies have found that neither increased recidivism nor crime was linked to it. They suggest instead that fearmongering and political calculations are guiding lawmakers’ thinking. “Enacting laws in reaction to isolated cases and scary headlines that are often inaccurate is not the way to make public policy,” said Laura Pitter, the deputy director of the U.S. Program at Human Rights Watch. Still, Ms. Hochul seems to have won support from Democratic leaders in both the Assembly and the Senate, which each have large numbers of avowed progressives, as well as from prosecutors. “I think it’s important and absolutely necessary to return discretion,” said J. Anthony Jordan, the district attorney in Washington County, a rural enclave northeast of Albany, who leads the state district attorneys association. “No two cases are the same. No two accused individuals appearing in front of the court are the same. And so to allow judges the flexibility to address each case appropriately is important.” The 2019 law came after years of building support for changes in the bail system, a cause crystallized by the case of a Bronx teenager named Kalief Browder, who spent three years on Rikers Island because his family could not raise $3,000 after his arrest on charges of stealing a backpack. That charge was later dropped for lack of evidence, but Mr. Browder eventually took his own life. The initial changes in New York came in the wake of similar efforts in California and New Jersey and eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, a change that affected thousands of defendants. For proponents, the changes offered the promise of new stability for communities decimated by decades of incarceration. But the changes were contested by law enforcement even before they took effect at the beginning of 2020. On Friday, many of the same groups that hailed the law in 2019 — including Mr. Browder’s family — were crestfallen by the proposed changes. “It would be unconscionable to send more people to these deadly jails,” said Akeem Browder, Kalief’s brother, “by weakening the bail laws passed in Kalief’s name.” For his part, Mr. Jordan said he believed that, “as important as it is to protect victims in society, it’s also equally important to protect the accused,” noting a major difference between someone who shoplifts a candy bar and someone who commits a more serious crime. “Finding how we sit in that middle ground — that’s been where the problem has lied,” he said. “And I think that’s what ought to be addressed. And hopefully gets addressed.” '),(17,'Gov. Hochul Gets a Budget Deal, but No Signature Win','The budget deal contained a series of hard-fought wins for the governor, but left her without a grand policy achievement to trumpet.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/hochul-budget-ny.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:28:03 +0000','ALBANY, N.Y. — It was around dinner time on Thursday, with many New York State lawmakers already heading home to their districts, when Gov. Kathy Hochul dropped a budget bombshell: Roughly four weeks past the deadline, she and legislative leaders had reached a tentative deal. She hastily convened a news conference in the Capitol’s ornate Red Room to announce the handshake agreement, but there were no hands to shake. Neither the leader of the Assembly nor the Senate was present, leaving Ms. Hochul to make a solitary victory lap around a $229 billion budget that, if passed by the Legislature next week, will be one month overdue. But the governor had no grand policy program to trumpet. She backed off from her pledge to construct 800,000 new homes, a potential centerpiece of her first term. She abandoned her push to ban menthol and other flavored cigarettes. The resulting agreement burnished the governor’s reputation as a centrist Democrat, with some of her key priorities — tough-on-crime changes to the state’s bail law, money set aside into reserves, and no new taxes or higher levies on the superrich — in line with more conservative themes. The deal also reflects Ms. Hochul’s willingness to seek a series of compromises with the liberal Legislature. The state will grant 22 new charter schools statewide, rather than the 100-odd ones in her initial proposal. New York’s minimum wage will rise, though not as far as some in the Legislature had hoped for. And a version of the progressive-backed Build Public Renewables Act will become law, but seemingly without some of the requirements that proponents said gave the measure its teeth. While Ms. Hochul on Thursday described her relationship with the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, as “stronger than you could possibly believe,” she also nodded to the friction in the process — perhaps unavoidable, given that many of the Democratic lawmakers are to the governor’s political left. “I will never shy away from a fight. You’re not always going to win,” she told reporters. “This state requires a leader who is not afraid to get knocked down once in a while. Because I always get back up.” Even so, the protracted conflict leaves Ms. Hochul in a somewhat tenuous position with lawmakers, just a year after pledging to forge a new, more collaborative Albany. Discussions over the budget were primarily waylaid by Ms. Hochul’s single-minded focus on bail, coming months after a bruising general election in which Republican candidates in New York blamed bail reform for the rise in pandemic-era crime. The strategy was a success; Democrats lost four House seats in New York, contributing to the party’s loss of power in the House. Ms. Hochul herself eked out a victory over her Republican challenger, Lee Zeldin, by the narrowest margin New York had seen in three decades. For Ms. Hochul — who, throughout her career, has demonstrated a desire to seek consensus and adapt her political views to better reflect her constituents — winning some changes to the bail laws was critical to counter the perception that she was lax on crime. While the response may have made political sense for Ms. Hochul, many lawmakers chafed at the request, coming so soon after they had been forced to defend the law during their own re-election campaigns. “In effect, bail was a blockade: to the flow of information, to the flow of deal-making, to the flow of collaboration,” said Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The conversations around bail prevented a lot of other good goals from advancing — namely her housing plan.” When Ms. Hochul took office in 2021 after the resignation of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, many lawmakers looked forward to a less heavy-handed approach from the governor’s office. Still, Mr. Cuomo used his power with brute effectiveness, especially around budget time. When disputes arose from his own party, he was known to reach deals with Republican leaders to force Democratic lawmakers’ hands. He took pride in delivering budget agreements before or shortly after the April 1 deadline. “In a sense, we got spoiled,” said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Democrat representing the Bronx. “Say what you want about Andrew Cuomo, but he got the budget done on time.” Several lawmakers remarked that it was one of the most opaque budget processes in their recollection, with fast-moving deals hatched behind closed doors, leaving rank-and-file members with no choice but to agree to proposals without seeing language. A recent example involved negotiations about environmental measures, which some Assembly members believed to still be continuing at the time that the governor announced the handshake deal. As late as Friday, lawmakers remained unclear on the final shape of environmental measures, including the proposal to incorporate parts of the Build Public Renewables Act into state law. Ms. Hochul also played down the delay in passage, saying that a good budget was preferable to a timely one. But as weeks dragged on, lawmakers grew increasingly frustrated about the process.  “It really is still three men in a room, just two happen to be women,” Patricia Fahy, a Democratic assemblywoman representing Albany, said of the negotiations among the leaders of the Senate, Assembly and governor. “That has not changed at all.” The governor’s move to emphasize policy matters, rather than financial issues, started negotiations off in conflict, lawmakers said. And while it is not unusual for governors to use their budgetary leverage to shoehorn in policy issues, some found the governor’s approach to be particularly blunt. But others suggested that she was simply making use of the tools at hand. “A majority of the majority probably did not want to do what she wanted to do on bail,” said Senator James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County who supported the changes. “In those cases, collaboration is going to get you so far.”  The fact that her agenda was opposed by members of her own party adds to an uncomfortable dynamic in the capital that has been brewing since Senate Democrats refused to seat her initial chief judge pick, Hector D. LaSalle. That dynamic was worsened by a growing agitation over Ms. Hochul’s efforts to squeeze so much policy into the state budget. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker, an architect and defender of the 2019 bail reforms suggested in a statement Thursday that she might vote against the budget, saying, “to put it mildly, this is not how democracy is supposed to work. I continue to reject efforts to hold the budget hostage in an attempt to jail more Black, brown and poor people pretrial.” But others celebrated the changes, saying they would help restore a sense of safety for New Yorkers after a tumultuous few years. “This will definitely help us with our fentanyl crisis we have in Suffolk County,” said Monica Martinez, a Democrat senator from Long Island. “It gives our judges and our prosecutors or D.A.s an extra tool to use to make our county safe.” By the time the governor had persuaded lawmakers to make small but meaningful tweaks to the bail law, there was little appetite for further compromise on an ambitious housing proposal that was opposed by some of the same suburban lawmakers whose support she desperately needed to push through criminal justice changes. Ms. Fahy said that she believed the budget would contain meaningful programs that would improve the lives of New Yorkers, but lamented the process that had left needed policies, like a solution to the state’s housing crisis, unfunded. Ms. Hochul has pledged to revive the issue outside the budget, but the monthlong delay means there will be little time to do so before session ends on June 8. “Is this the most difficult budget? Yes,” Ms. Fahy said. “By a long shot.” '),(18,'Evacuations of 4 NYC Parking Garages Ordered After Earlier Collapse','In a sweep of dozens of garages, engineers found unsafe conditions including deteriorated steel beams and cracked or crumbling concrete.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/parking-garage-evacuations-nyc.html','Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:57:06 +0000','In the wake of a deadly collapse of a parking garage in Lower Manhattan last week, New York City officials found structural problems at four other garages so dangerous they ordered the buildings at least partially vacated. At those four garages — two in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn — the city’s Buildings Department found that the structures had “deteriorated to the point where they were now posing an immediate threat to public safety,” said Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for the department. The discoveries, he said, came during inspections of garages conducted after the April 18 collapse of a garage on Ann Street in the Financial District in Manhattan that left its manager dead in the rubble and five others injured. Engineers found that a two-story garage at 2781 Stillwell Avenue in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn was in “severe disrepair,” Mr. Rudansky said. The department issued a “full vacate order” for the entire building and ordered its owners to close for business and immediately retain a professional engineer to compile a structural report, he said. In a multilevel garage beneath a 25-story apartment building in Battery Park City, engineers found concrete that was “extensively corroded” and “spalled concrete” on the underside of two floor slabs, Mr. Rudansky said. Spalling is a sign that concrete is deteriorating. It often happens when water seeps into the concrete and corrodes steel bars embedded inside the slab. The corroded steel expands and causes the concrete to crack and crumble, or spall. Spalling of the concrete in a parking garage was cited as a factor in the 2021 collapse of the Champlain Towers condominium complex in Surfside, Fla. At the Battery Park City garage, at 225 Rector Place, the Buildings Department ordered 60 percent of the structure to be vacated and directed the owners to install a protective pathway for drivers to reach their cars safely in the rest of the garage, Mr. Rudansky said. He said the department ordered the building’s owners to retain a professional engineer to compile a structural report on the garage, but added that the department’s engineers did not find any reason for the apartments above the garage to be vacated. While the investigation into the cause of the Ann Street collapse continues, inspectors fanned out to assess the condition of 78 garages across the city. Mr. Rudansky said 17 of those garages were managed by the same company that managed the one that collapsed. The other 61 had previously been cited for serious structural issues that the department’s records showed had not been resolved, he said. Before last year, owners of parking garages in New York City were not required to have their structures inspected periodically. But under a new local law, garages in Manhattan below 59th Street and on the Upper West Side must hire qualified engineers and file inspection reports before the end of 2023, and every two years after that. Garages in other parts of the city will also be required to have inspections, but with later deadlines to file their first reports. Another of the garages that received an order to vacate is beneath an eight-story apartment building at 50 Bayard Street, in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan. Engineers found “numerous severely deteriorated and rusted steel beams, with excessive cracked and spalling concrete piers in various locations throughout the parking structure,” Mr. Rudansky said. They also found that the required fireproofing materials were missing in various areas, he said. The building’s owners were ordered to vacate the entire garage, as well as part of the cellar. They must also retain a professional engineer and hire a general contractor to immediately provide emergency shoring inside of the building. The engineers did not find that it was necessary to vacate the apartments. At a two-story garage in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, at 429 12th Street, engineers found “structurally compromised and extensively corroded slab beams and columns,” Mr. Rudansky said. They also found that parts of the second-floor slab and vehicle ramp were “deteriorated” and the wooden roof joists on the second floor were in a “state of disrepair.” The department ordered that areas with unsafe conditions be vacated — about 400 square feet of the building. The garage must bring in a professional engineer and a contractor to shore up the “compromised” areas.

Averts Fiscal Crisis as New York Strikes Budget Deal','A budget agreement reached by Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers will provide desperately needed funding for the transit system, which faced a potential budget gap of nearly $3 billion by 2025.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/mta-fare-hike-budget.html','Fri, 28 Apr 2023 19:01:42 +0000','New York City’s transit system dodged a budget disaster this week after Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers agreed to give the Metropolitan Transportation Authority the money it needs to help stave off a gargantuan deficit that was triggered, in part, by the pandemic. Ms. Hochul’s office said the budget would provide new and recurring funding for the authority through an increase in the payroll tax paid by the city’s big businesses, which is expected to generate about $1.1 billion for the agency. The agreement includes a one-time payment from the state of $300 million, and it has earmarked an additional $65 million to reduce a proposed fare hike. New York City will need to pitch in $165 million, a partial victory for Mayor Eric Adams because it is significantly less than the yearly $500 million Ms. Hochul had initially asked the city to pay. The state has also promised the agency some of the future revenues from casinos that it is planning to open. Through a pilot program, New York will also make one bus route in each borough free, down from the two per borough that were initially proposed. The deal creates a more permanent funding stream for the M.T.A., which is often at the center of feuds between the city and state over how to prop up its finances. During each budget cycle, the authority has had to jockey for money against an array of other interests. There is also a long history of state and city officials from both parties cutting transit funds or diverting them to other uses. Janno Lieber, the authority’s chairman, praised the budget agreement and said it would “assure the M.T.A.’s long-term financial stability.” Transit advocates also thanked the state for moving to put the authority on more steady financial footing. “This was the most consistent and dependable funding proposal on the table,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for Riders Alliance, a grass-roots organization of transit riders. The authority was facing a potential budget gap of nearly $3 billion by 2025. The Covid-19 emergency plunged the system into crisis as riders abandoned it, depleting fare revenue it had critically depended on. But while the M.T.A. has lost nearly half its annual operating revenue during the pandemic, its budget problems have long predated it. Since at least the 1970s, when the system struggled with crumbling infrastructure and anemic revenues during the city’s fiscal crisis, transit leaders have struggled to find ways to stabilize its finances. The system was saved from decay in the early 1980s when lawmakers allowed it to issue bonds. But the authority’s debt load exploded, and expenses have outpaced income. A fare hike remains on the table for riders. Transit leaders had contemplated raising the standard price of a New York City subway ride to just over $3 in less than three years, even if they got the bailout they sought from the state. That proposal would have seen the current $2.75 base fare rise to $2.90 by this year and to $3.02 in 2025. The state deal will provide $65 million to reduce the first potential fare hike, which could bring the fare closer to $2.86 instead of $2.90. The authority’s chief financial officer has said that any fare changes would be preceded by public hearings and a board vote. There has not been a fare hike since the start of the pandemic. The authority has raised fares about 4 percent every two years since 2009, but it put off a planned round of increases in 2021 because it wanted to lure riders back. '),(20,'The Unemployment Gap Between Black and White New Yorkers Is Widening','The unemployment rate for Black New Yorkers rose to 12.2 percent in the first quarter of the year, while the white unemployment rate dropped to 1.3 percent, a new report says.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/jobs/black-unemployment-rate-nyc.html','Fri, 28 Apr 2023 20:28:05 +0000','The gulf between Black and white unemployment rates in New York City is now the widest it has been this century, exceeding even the largest gap during the Great Recession, according to a new report. In the first three months of the year, the unemployment rate for Black New Yorkers rose to 12.2 percent, the highest rate of any group, while the white unemployment rate dropped to 1.3 percent, the lowest it has been since 2000, according to the report, which was released Thursday by the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School. The overall unemployment rate among New Yorkers was 5.3 percent. The New York City figures are out of step with the national picture. The nationwide Black unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, and the white unemployment rate was 3.2 percent. National figures include Black Hispanic job seekers, whereas the New York data does not. The Black and white unemployment rates in New York City have not continuously diverged for at least a year in about 25 years, and it is happening at a time when Black unemployment nationwide is approaching new lows, said James A. Parrott, a co-author of the report and the director of economic and fiscal policy at the center. The widening gap now threatens the city’s recovery from the pandemic, potentially exacerbating income inequality in one of the world’s most expensive cities. The stark racial differences in joblessness stem from a variety of factors, including the differences in the types of jobs that Black and white New Yorkers work, racism in the employment process and historical differences in job qualifications that are rooted in discriminatory policies of the past, experts said. From 2020 to the end of 2021, with some of the strictest Covid-related rules in the nation, 310,000 New Yorkers lost their jobs to permanent business closures, and another 406,000 to downsizing, Dr. Parrott said. But the unemployment gap is not fully explained by those losses. The industries that suffered the most were “face-to-face” trades like retail, construction and hospitality. Those losses disproportionately affected Latino workers, who have regained jobs faster than Black New Yorkers. And some of the industries that added the most jobs in New York last year were tech and finance, leading to disproportionate gains for white and Asian job seekers, Dr. Parrott said. The report used seasonally adjusted data, following a method used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After both the white and Black unemployment rates fell throughout 2021, the Black unemployment rate began rising again in the first quarter of 2022, as the white unemployment rate continued to fall. The gap between the two has roughly doubled since, from 5.2 percentage points to 10.9 percentage points, Dr. Parrott said. The last time the unemployment gap came close to that was during the Great Recession, when it was 10.3 percentage points over the first half of 2009. “This sort of sustained divergence hasn’t happened before,” at least in this century, Dr. Parrott said. “Race-based discrimination is a big part of that,” he said, noting that data shows Black job seekers are often among the last to be chosen for openings. The city’s Economic Development Corporation, which uses a different method of analysis, reported on Friday that the rate of Black unemployment had risen to 10.4 percent while the white unemployment rate had fallen to 2.5 percent. In a statement, Mayor Eric Adams said that since he took office last year, New York City had added more than 250,000 private sector jobs. “But that opportunity has not been shared equally and we are taking aggressive action to rebuild an equitable economy that helps New Yorkers who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and address the high unemployment rate among Black New Yorkers,” he said. City and state policies to spur job growth have not focused enough on the hardest-hit communities, said Barika Williams, the executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development, a nonprofit housing and economic justice coalition. “Recovery is not happening evenly across the city,” she said, especially in majority-Black neighborhoods. “That we are now in a bigger unemployment gap than we were in Covid feels shocking,” she added. Ronnie Coaxum, 60, said he was laid off in 2020 from a position in the food and beverage division of the Marriott Marquis hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where he had worked for 36 years. The job search has been difficult; on Thursday, he traveled from his home in the South Bronx to a career center in Harlem, seeking work. “I’ve been doing temp work, I’ve been doing security,” he said. “I’ve been doing maintenance jobs, just bouncing around.” He was not surprised by the growing racial disparity in the unemployment rates. “It’s always been like that,” he said. “I feel it in job interviews, but I just have to be myself. I don’t let it bother me.” The job search has also been difficult for younger people. About 17 percent of New Yorkers in the labor force between the ages of 18 and 24 were unemployed, according to the report, with young Black men disproportionately represented in that group. And for Black men who have prior criminal convictions, the search can be doubly hard, said Christopher Watler, the executive vice president of the Center for Employment Opportunities, a career development agency for people with criminal records. Raliek Mitchiner, 22, who had a conviction when he was a minor, said he did not receive calls back for several jobs he has applied for since 2021. “When they hear Raliek, they automatically assume ‘he’s Black,’” he said. “No one knows that I’m a good worker, I’m a good guy, and it sucks.” Mr. Mitchiner began working as a paid intern in January at the Center for Employment Opportunities, and he also works the night shift as a support specialist at a mental health facility in the Bronx. The first position was only open to him because of his past conviction. “I had to get in trouble to work,” he said. He landed the second thanks to a relative who referred him for the role. On Thursday, Zsanay Anderson, 19, waited at the Department of Labor office in Downtown Brooklyn, hoping for an update on her application for unemployment benefits, which she had submitted six weeks earlier. “They didn’t help,” Ms. Anderson said. “All they said is they’re still reviewing.” Ms. Anderson lost her job in March as a case manager for a nonprofit social services agency, where she helped connect homeless people with shelter and mental health services. She lives in a domestic violence shelter in Flatbush with her mother, after they fled a physically abusive relationship in North Carolina last year. In North Carolina, Ms. Anderson was working as a restaurant manager and preparing to go to college to earn a two-year degree. She said she planned to enroll in college in New York, and hoped she could go from living in a shelter to a dorm room. But first, she wants to work. “I have plenty of experience,” she said, citing past roles in customer service and child care. The search for a new job had gone “horribly” until earlier this week, she said, when she got a call from a social services provider in Brooklyn. Her next stop was to visit the employer’s office for fingerprinting and a background check. ');

INSERT INTO `nytToday_US` VALUES (1,'A Georgia Town Where ‘Stranger Things’ Is Shot Yearns for Production to Return','The impact of the writers’ and actors’ strikes has rippled far from Hollywood, including to the town where “Stranger Things” is partially filmed.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/jackson-ga-stranger-things-hollywood-strike.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 09:01:10 +0000','Before a hole could pierce open a parallel dimension, unleashing murderous creatures like a Demogorgon into the placid existence of Hawkins, Ind., there needed to be another invasion. Hawkins, the fictional home of “Stranger Things,” had to take over the small town in Georgia where the hit Netflix show has been set since it debuted in 2016. The old county courthouse in the center of Jackson, Ga., was turned into the Hawkins Library. An empty storefront became Melvald’s General Store. On the other side of the town square, a marquee was added to the front of a restaurant, transforming it into Hawkins’s movie theater. But lately, Jackson has just been Jackson. “Stranger Things” retreated, along with most of the other movies and television shows filmed in Georgia, as the writers’ strike that began in May and the actors’ strike that followed in July reached far beyond Hollywood. The writers reached a tentative deal with studios in late September, and a ratification vote is underway. But actors are still negotiating with entertainment companies, keeping most TV and film production shut down. As some of the nation’s most generous film tax credits have nudged movie and television studios to invest heavily in Georgia over the last 15 years, a number of cities and towns have tried to get a piece of the business. But the state’s embrace of the film industry has sometimes awkwardly collided with the conservative politics of its Republican leaders, who generally believe that resisting organized labor is a key to a welcoming business climate. The economic pain inflicted by the work stoppages has prompted some elected officials, including the state’s labor commissioner, to reconsider Georgia’s relationship with the entertainment industry and the incentives that lured it in. “I think those on strike better think long and hard about whether they think Georgia is a place where those incentives should stay in place,” the commissioner, Bruce Thompson, said in an interview before the Writers Guild of America reached its tentative deal. But in places like Butts County, home to Jackson, some local officials have been more loath to criticize the strikes. Michael Brewer, whose job as deputy county manager includes serving as a liaison to the film and television industry, acknowledged the disruption, particularly for consumers. “But I’m also trying to see it from the industry point of view,” he said. “With inflation, with cost changes, the value of a dollar they made is not the same that it was,” Mr. Brewer added. “A lot of things have changed over the last few years. They have to make sure their rights are protected.” The climate in Georgia, including its status as a right-to-work state where workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment, has made organizing a challenge and left the writers and actors guilds with a limited footprint. The Writers Guild, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, has only a few dozen members in the state. But many nonunion workers in Georgia’s film industry have expressed solidarity with their striking peers, whose concerns included decreased pay in the streaming era and the threat posed by artificial intelligence, even as they have struggled to make ends meet in recent months. The state typically has dozens of movies and television shows in production, but in recent months, filming has been limited mostly to reality series, like “Hoarders” and “Love & Hip-Hop Atlanta.” “It’s kind of hard not to be salty about it, but I understand — the strikes needed to happen,” said Liz Bowman, who was a special effects artist for “Stranger Things” before the strikes began and has since been giving tours of locations from the show in Jackson. “I love the film industry, but I feel like sometimes you get these big studios and they forget that they have real people working for them.” The strikes have meant fewer tourists, who prefer to come to Jackson when “Stranger Things” is filming, hoping to see or possibly interact with actors from the show. The infusion of money that comes with production has dried up, taking away the corresponding boost for local businesses or the pay for shutting down stores or using homes for filming. Jackson took advantage of its farmland and small-town appearance, interstate access and proximity to Atlanta to turn itself into something of a filming destination for movies and television shows. Lake Jackson became a popular location, as did Bucksnort Road, a long, lonely strip of pavement between sprawling fields. Some in town have capitalized on the “Stranger Things” ties. An escape room attraction opened with the show as its theme. Bradley’s Olde Tavern — the stand-in for the Hawkins movie theater — has special drinks, like Demogorgon Blood (vodka, Dr Pepper, orange soda and grenadine). The association with one of the hottest shows on television has not been to every resident’s liking; some preferred the relative obscurity of Jackson before “Stranger Things.” The show’s supernatural themes and monsters have not been entirely warmly received in an overwhelmingly Christian community. When the old courthouse was still active, judges did not appreciate the commotion caused by productions and would dispatch the sheriff to quiet them down. More broadly, there have been clashes between Georgia’s conservative politics and a largely left-leaning industry. In 2019, actors and directors threatened boycotts after state lawmakers approved a bill severely restricting abortion access. And conservative leaders have said the industry is partly to blame for Georgia, once reliably Republican, becoming a swing state where Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win since 1992. But in Jackson, there has also been a recognition that the industry has injected vitality into a town that had been languishing. The spot where Hannah Thompson opened Hawkins Headquarters, a store on the town square with a “Stranger Things” theme, had been vacant for seven years. “It’s like a little bit of life has been breathed back in because of ‘Stranger Things,’” she said. Even with the turbulence, Ms. Bowman, 29, has felt somewhat lucky, relishing the opportunity to connect with fans of the show from as far away as the Philippines who stop in Jackson for the tour (pizza and snacks included). “I know a lot of stunt people that are working for GameStop right now because they can’t get jobs,” she said. “I know a lot of camera people who straight up went to go work for Best Buy.” With the writers’ strike over, there have been encouraging signs. Mr. Brewer said he had gotten inquiries from location scouts after months of silence. Ticket sales for the “Stranger Things” tour have surged, Ms. Thompson said. They hope that “Stranger Things” will come back sooner rather than later, as the series is planning its final season. Filming was supposed to start in May, right around when the writers’ strike got underway. Sylvia Redic, Jackson’s city manager, keeps hearing the same question: “When is Season 5?” she said. “And that’s directly affected by the strike.” '),(2,'A Texas Community Attracts Migrant Home Buyers, and Republican Ire','The development near Houston offers cheap land and unconventional financing to buyers, many of them undocumented immigrants. Gov. Greg Abbott has called for hearings.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/texas-migrants-housing-colony-ridge.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 09:02:28 +0000','In the dense, damp forests northeast of Houston, a pair of brothers hit on a viable real estate business model: Offer plots of cheap land and unconventional loans for people who wanted to build their own houses, with few restrictions. The concept took off, not least among the large population of undocumented immigrants in Texas, who often do not have the legal paperwork needed for most bank loans. The Colony Ridge community, whose first residents moved in a decade ago, is now home to 40,000 people or more, with plans to more than double in size. Over the years, its swift growth and predominantly Hispanic population drew opposition from the mostly white residents of a small nearby town and some local officials, who lodged complaints and filed lawsuits. Opponents spray painted “Build that wall” on one of the developer’s billboards after Donald J. Trump’s election. One sent a desiccated chicken foot — and a note describing a voodoo hex — as a warning to the county judge. But with a new wave of migrants arriving at the southern border in recent weeks, the sprawling development has become a lightning rod for conservatives in the state and highlighted a growing tension within the Republican Party: those who focus on business freedom, and others determined to control the border. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a hard-right conservative, took a helicopter tour of Colony Ridge last month and said that it appeared to be growing with “unprecedented speed” and could reach 100,000 residents in the next decade. “This should not come as a shock to anyone,” Mr. Patrick wrote on his campaign website after his tour. “Where does President Biden think the millions of people he has allowed into the country are going to live? The federal government drops thousands of people in the streets every day in Texas and cities across America.” The political uproar was fueled by a story last month in The Daily Wire, which noted that the area at one point had the fastest-growing Hispanic population in the United States and was struggling to provide adequate schools and policing. It warned, without evidence, that the area could become “a strategic asset for cartels.” “We’re taking this very seriously,” Gov. Greg Abbott said on Fox News, adding that the state had deployed troopers to the area and subpoenaed bank records of the developers to find out “exactly what is going on.” Mr. Abbott directed the Legislature to hold hearings on Colony Ridge during a special session that starts on Monday. The development is a product of Texas’ developer-friendly culture — one of the owners of Colony Ridge is a major donor to Mr. Abbott — that has allowed for the creation of cheap housing amid a national housing crisis, as well as the use of a little-known method of financing that allows undocumented immigrants to obtain home loans without traditional credit scores or Social Security numbers. The result has been an unusual but also distinctly Texan sort of boomtown — row after row of affordable homes and trailers, taquerias and pickup trucks — emerging where not long before there had been nothing. “The developer has told us to expect 150 new students a month,” said Stephen McCanless, the superintendent of the Cleveland Independent School District, which includes Colony Ridge. The district has nearly doubled in size, to about 11,800 students in three years, he said, and is 85 percent Hispanic. The vast majority — more than 10,000 — were born in the United States, according to data provided by the district. About 1,400 were born elsewhere, with the largest contingents coming from Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador. Mr. McCanless said he has spent $12 million on portable classrooms. “It’s such fast growth. I don’t believe any community can keep up with that,” he said. Voters in Liberty County — where Republicans control all the elected offices — have rejected proposals for new bonds to help the schools expand. The county judge, Jay Knight, said he would like the development to have grown more slowly, so the local community could adjust, and for the county to have more control. But he said state law provides few powers to counties to regulate development. “We follow the law,” he said, sitting at his desk, a cellphone occasionally erupting with a ringtone of bellowing cattle. “It didn’t happen overnight, and it’s going to take years to fix.” Mr. Knight said he had negotiated with Colony Ridge to include building requirements on some of their newer developments, such as minimum square footage. Still, some in the community have attacked him for not doing more to curb the development. He described receiving the chicken foot in the mail two years ago, along with a note, apparently purchased online. “It was a voodoo hex,” he said, adding that he believed it had been sent by an outspoken former official in the town of Plum Grove, which borders the Colony Ridge development. Matthew Poston, the county attorney, said that while the issue had become politicized, there were real challenges presented by such rapid growth in a relatively poor part of the state. “For the folks who want to say that all the residents of Plum Grove are racist: They have actual valid concerns here,” he said, such as the deterioration of their roads from so much car traffic. “Even if you solved the illegal immigration aspect, we still have tens of thousands of very legal citizens living in that part of the woods.” The development, which stretches over more than 10,000 acres and includes several subdivisions, is a rough mix of building styles and incomes, with two-story houses selling for more than $200,000 near old trailer homes on overgrown plots or partially built structures. New commercial businesses have sprung up: a grocery store, a Domino’s Pizza, a Chinese restaurant run by a family from Mexico. Dogs roam freely. “Land is cheaper here, we can actually get our own house,” said Cynthia Foster, 32, who moved to the area with her partner and two children and now lives in a three-bedroom house behind the Family Dollar store, where she works. New roads are dotted with signs in Spanish and English advertising plots of land for a down payment as low as $500. “Fire and EMS Coming Soon!” another sign reads. The development company offers direct financing to buyers, including those with bad or no credit and those who have only a federal tax number as a form of identification. So-called I.T.I.N. loans are legal under state and federal law and are based on an individual tax identification number issued by the Internal Revenue Service, issued to those not eligible for Social Security numbers, such as migrants who have no legal work authorization. “Anybody can buy a house,” said Christopher Almaraz, a real estate agent who has sold homes in Colony Ridge. One 40-year-old migrant who came from Honduras in 2006 and asked that her name not be used said she sold dresses to help care for her three children. Standing at her front door, she said she and her husband, a construction worker also from Honduras, had gotten an I.T.I.N. loan for a $200,000 house, with $60,000 down. “We wanted to live in a house,” she said. Such loans generally have higher interest rates. Colony Ridge typically charges about 13 percent, said John Harris, who owns the development company along with his brother William. “We found properties that no one wanted and people who couldn’t buy anywhere else,” John Harris said, sitting at a boardroom table in the Colony Ridge offices near a map of the development. “There’s a lot of demand for people who want to be left alone to do what they want.” Most customers, he said, came from Houston or its suburbs. While their approach could work elsewhere, the area of Liberty County where Colony Ridge has developed is unique in its size, low land costs, low taxes and proximity to a major city, the brothers said. William Harris said the company’s Hispanic buyers were most often reliable “payers,” though about 20 percent of the loans the company offered overall ended up in foreclosure, a far higher rate than is common with traditional home mortgages. He said they were aware that many residents did not have legal status in the United States. “We’re not border patrol. We’re not immigration,” he said. “There are lawmakers in this country and that’s their responsibility to keep our borders safe.” William Harris, who has donated more than $1 million in recent years to Mr. Abbott’s campaigns, said he was disappointed to see the governor attack Colony Ridge on national television. “He’s a politician, it is what it is, he’s got to cover his butt first,” Mr. Harris said. “But don’t expect a million dollars next year. It ain’t happening again, brother.” Around the development, residents said they had recently noticed helicopters flying overhead, an apparent result of the increased attention from state leaders. “We’ve asked for years for more law enforcement,” said Cynthia Silva, 30, who runs a Spanish language news site focused on Liberty County and lives in the Colony Ridge development. She stopped in to see her friend, Raquel Reyna, 42, who has made her two plots into a makeshift farm and animal shelter. Ms. Reyna has around 50 chickens, many cats, several goats and, at the moment, 23 stray dogs, some of which, she said, were bound for adoption in New York. “We saw so many dogs in the street, my heart broke,” she said. Ms. Reyna came from Mexico at 19 and lived for two decades in Houston before buying land from Colony Ridge on an overgrown cul-de-sac for $52,000. She and her husband and children live in a trailer but are planning to build a house and have been trying to improve the neighborhood. The presence of state troopers sent by Mr. Abbott appeared to have calmed some of the random gunfire that has plagued the area lately, she said, and she has organized local trash cleanups among neighbors. The United States is a good country for those who want to live right, she said. “If you live well, you’ll live in peace.” '),(3,'Newsom Vetoes Bill Banning Caste Discrimination','The bill had driven intense debate within the growing South Asian community in California.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/california-caste-discrimination.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 21:53:44 +0000','Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have made California the first state in the country to expressly ban discrimination based on caste, stating that the measure was “unnecessary” because it was already covered by existing laws. The bill, known as Senate Bill 403, had driven intense debate — and divisions — within the growing South Asian community in California recently, especially in Silicon Valley, where South Asians make up a significant share of the work force. Governor Newsom’s rejection of the bill is a victory for some Hindu residents and organizations who had argued that the proposal unfairly targeted them because the caste system is most commonly associated with Hinduism. They asserted that caste discrimination in the United States was rare and that existing laws banning discrimination on the basis of ancestry and religion were sufficient. “This has been months of concern and stress that we’ve been carrying about the impact that this would have on the civil rights of all South Asians regardless of background, and we’re glad the governor saw the problems with it,” said Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, one of the organizations leading the opposition. It comes as a blow to proponents of the bill who had argued that an explicit ban on caste discrimination was needed to increase awareness that such bias exists in the United States and to reassure victims who want to come forward. A group of South Asian activists had been on a hunger strike outside of Mr. Newsom’s office since early September to urge the governor to sign the bill. In recent years, several universities and companies have added caste to their discrimination policies. Late last month, Fresno officially became the first city in California, and the second in the country after Seattle, to enact such a ban. But Governor Newsom is considering a future run for the White House, and he may not have wanted to get in the middle of longstanding ethnic and religious tensions among some Indian Americans, who are a fast-growing and vital demographic in purple suburbs and swing states. This month, Republican state legislators, who largely opposed the measure, sent Mr. Newsom a letter echoing arguments from the bill’s opponents. For thousands of years, Dalits have been a historically oppressed group of people relegated below even the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy in South Asia. India officially outlawed caste discrimination more than 70 years ago, but attitudes and social stratification persist. In more than a dozen recent interviews with The New York Times, people of Dalit ancestry described various encounters with caste-based bigotry in the United States, in the form of wage theft, housing discrimination, mistreatment in the workplace and social exclusion. For decades, the South Asian diaspora was composed mainly of upper caste people, in part because they had greater access to the resources necessary to qualify for skilled worker visas. More recently, though, affirmative action policies in India have allowed more people from oppressed communities to attend universities and move abroad. The caste issue burst into the public conversation in 2020 when California’s Civil Rights Department sued Cisco Systems, accusing two of the company’s engineers of caste discrimination. Awareness of such discrimination has grown since then, and in March, Aisha Wahab, a California state senator, introduced Senate Bill 403. Senator Wahab’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. California lawmakers are not expected to override the veto. But other states and cities could introduce measures banning caste discrimination. State regulators in California have continued to pursue their lawsuit against Cisco, though they dismissed their claims against the engineers. Opponents of the bill are likely to continue arguing against new protections. Last year, two Hindu professors sued California State University, hoping to block its addition of caste to its discrimination policy.

Nearly 3,000 people were packed inside, all to hear a college professor from Alabama conduct a “forensic analysis” of how Ms. Chapin’s son and three of his college friends had been brutally murdered in Idaho last year. Ms. Chapin backed herself into an alcove to observe the discussion, muttering as the speaker mispronounced the name of her son’s girlfriend, who was also one of the victims, then botched the description of the landscape around the crime scene. The audience was captivated, but within minutes Ms. Chapin was quietly pushing herself out a side door. “Why does that person get to talk about my kid in front of all those people?” Ms. Chapin whispered in the hallway. Then she wondered: “Should I go up on the stage?” Ten months ago, Ms. Chapin was thrust into the center of the nation’s obsession with true crime, as armies of podcast listeners, internet commentators and amateur sleuths were consumed by the mystery of how Ethan Chapin and three other University of Idaho students had been stabbed to death late one night in a house near campus. Now she found herself navigating an unfamiliar world where she was an unwitting celebrity, searching for a way to harness the fervor for something good. She arrived as a guest of CrimeCon, where — after paying for tickets that start at $349 — attendees could measure blood spatter, analyze the drawings of a serial killer, cheer their crime-solving heroes and absorb the gory details of notorious rapes and murders. The annual conference, which this year drew 5,000 people from all 50 states, capitalizes on what has been a breakneck level of growth in the true crime genre: Last week, of the 20 top podcasts on the Apple platform, more than half were related to true crime. Some attendees described their fascination with criminal minds; others said they felt deep empathy with the victims, and were lured by the enticing possibility that someone asking the right questions or unearthing a missing digital clue could help bring justice to a stricken family. Relatives of some of those families also signed up, posting materials and sharing stories, overjoyed that people and podcasters were eager to listen. In the exhibition hall, businesses vied for attention, one offering true-crime branded coffee, as the crackle of someone testing a stun gun was heard from a table nearby. A crime-scene cleaning company had set up a bloodied cardboard box, next to a booth where attendees could get photos of themselves against a perp-lineup backdrop. Ms. Chapin flinched and turned away as a television screen flashed images of the man accused of killing her son. Attendees had the chance to mingle with the stars of the genre: A YouTuber grabbed a selfie with Camille Vasquez, the lawyer known for her recent work representing the actor Johnny Depp. Dozens lined up to meet the former cold case detective, Paul Holes. The conference’s welcome party featured Creighton Waters — the prosecutor who led the murder case against the South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh — doing a rendition of “Brown-Eyed Girl” on guitar. Ms. Chapin had never been a follower of true crime nor, frankly, understood its appeal. Over the past year, she has largely avoided most of the news coverage and public discussion of her son’s murder, but in the early days of the case she got a glimpse into the power of the true crime community to galvanize and organize — sometimes in alarming ways. As word of her son’s case spread via a broad network of YouTube channels, TikTok personalities and Facebook groups, true crime sleuths were captivated by the Idaho mystery, one where a killer had managed to fatally stab four people on two floors of a rental home before exiting into the night. With no suspects emerging and police pleading for tips, thousands of online sleuths went to work. They uploaded maps of the neighborhood and floor plans of the house, and analyzed photos, including one that some thought revealed blood seeping down its outer walls. They scoured social media interactions, freeze-framing a Twitch livestream video that showed two of the victims stopping at a food truck hours before they were killed. They proposed a series of theories: that an ex-boyfriend had committed the crime, or a roommate of the victims, or a neighbor who had been doing interviews, or a man in a hoodie who was seen in the crowd in the Twitch video. Some of the “suspects” — college students whose only real connection to the crime was their friendship with the victims, and their own keen sense of loss — became true crime villains overnight. Ms. Chapin recalled her fury upon learning that some had been speculating that her son might have carried out the atrocity as part of a murder-suicide plan. Even after a real suspect was arrested — Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student in criminology at a nearby university — the sleuths continued to speculate, offering alternative theories despite DNA evidence and cellphone tracking data described by prosecutors as linking Mr. Kohberger to the crime. For Ms. Chapin and much of the university community in the small town of Moscow, Idaho, the killing had left a wave of shock and grief in its wake. At CrimeCon, she hoped her presence would help people remember what had been lost. She also wanted to connect with other victim families who were looking to find community and build support for a foundation that will award college scholarships in her son’s honor. She had not even had a chance to pick up her badge at the conference before a woman wearing a “Basically a Detective” T-shirt — on sale in the gift shop — approached Ms. Chapin to give her a tearful hug, thanking her for her grace and expressing sympathy for her loss. At a meeting of family members of crime victims, she met relatives of Gabby Petito, who was killed by her fiancé in 2021 during a cross-country road trip. It was a case where true crime aficionados had found a chance to shine: Ms. Petito’s body was found after mass attention to the family’s pleas for help on social media resulted in thousands of tips. All in all, Ms. Chapin said she had found earnest support and people wanting to help. The convention sold copies of her children’s book about Ethan, “The Boy Who Wore Blue,” written after his death. She mingled with journalists, to help tell her son’s story. Four sessions at the conference were dedicated at least in part to discussing the Idaho case. As Ms. Chapin stepped out of the session led by the Alabama professor, she first sought refuge in a private lounge, where she came upon CrimeCon’s founder, Kevin Balfe. She explained to him how unnerving it was to hear someone she did not know, and who lacked a full command of the case’s details, speak about the killings to such a large audience. “There are so many people in there,” she told him. “It is shocking.” The session, Mr. Balfe said, was one of the conference’s biggest draws. He said he had spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to present a recent crime that was of such deep interest to so many people. A court-issued gag order had prevented the usual mix of prosecutors or investigators or family members from talking about it in detail. Mr. Balfe said he had selected Joseph Scott Morgan, a professor of forensics at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Ala., and host of the “Body Bags” podcast, because he was someone he trusted not to indulge in sensationalism. Mr. Balfe said he had wondered earlier what would happen if Ms. Chapin were to visit the session during the conference. “I wish I had called you and said, ‘Don’t go in there,’” he told her. It was a difficult situation, Ms. Chapin conceded. As they separated, she continued to fret. Should she go back into the professor’s session, and go on the stage herself? She walked back in. The professor was still onstage, taking questions from the audience, and speculating about how the knife sheath found at the scene with the suspect’s DNA on it might be considered at trial. Ms. Chapin got in line at a microphone, waiting for a chance to speak, her hands clasped behind her back. Then the professor asked for her question. “My name is Stacy Chapin, and I’m Ethan’s mom,” she began. The crowd gasped, then applauded. Some stood to take photos. Ms. Chapin spoke briefly, her voice shaking, explaining that she wanted the crowd to know that all the positive things that people had heard about the victims were true. “Don’t forget these kids,” she told the crowd. “They were amazing, amazing kids, in the prime of their life.” As she departed, people surrounded her, asking for hugs, laying their hands on her, rubbing her back, sharing stories of why her son’s case had meant so much to them. The moment, she said, was empowering. She hoped it offered people something to consider as they consumed their next true crime episode. “It’s pure entertainment at some level,” she said. “That entertainment piece — there’s a real face behind that. There are real people behind these stories. Don’t ever forget that.” '),(5,'U.S. Continues Push for Saudi-Israel Ties Even as War With Hamas Begins','As Israel prepares an offensive in Gaza, President Biden and his aides are gauging whether Saudi officials remain interested in opening up diplomatic relations.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/saudi-arabia-israel-palestinians-hamas.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:43:01 +0000','President Biden’s top aides scrambled on Sunday to reaffirm their commitment to the idea of potential normalization of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, even as Israel prepares for the start of a full-scale war against Palestinian militants. On several American talk shows, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken cast normalization as a choice between regional peace and the terrorism carried out by Hamas, the militant group in Gaza. “It would really change the prospects of the entire region far into the future,” Mr. Blinken said on CBS News of Israel’s broadening of relations with Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the most powerful Sunni Muslim nation in the region. “Now, who’s opposed to that? Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran. So, I think that speaks volumes. And there are really two paths before the region.” Mr. Blinken added an important caveat, which was that the drive for a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia could not be a substitute for a two-state solution to address the needs of the Palestinians. But American officials have been unable to make headway on that for decades. So in both the Trump and Biden administrations, a main diplomatic effort in the Middle East has been promoting normalization between Israel and Arab nations, with Palestinian officials and representatives playing no real role in the talks. The theory for some American and Israeli officials and Arab leaders was that such deals, in the form of the Abraham Accords, would help isolate and suppress the Palestinian issue, which they saw as an intractable problem. Jared Kushner, former President Donald J. Trump’s son-in-law and a White House adviser who helped forge the accords, was a main proponent of that thinking. To critics, that has been the crux of the problem, and one reason the United States and Israel were blindsided by the Hamas attack on Saturday. The crowds of civilians in Gaza cheering the Hamas fighters underscored the extent of anti-Israel hostility among Palestinians — hostility that American, Israeli and Arab officials have tried to ignore for years as they pushed normalization talks and what the Biden administration has called “regional integration.” “Prior to the Hamas attack on Israel, there was bipartisan agreement, shared by most of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, that the question of Palestine no longer matters in the Middle East,” said Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East politics at Georgetown University. He added that he believed Arab leaders have relayed that same message in private because they dislike how their citizens mobilize around Palestinian issues. “The masses of Arabs and Muslims had a different view of this equation — but who in D.C. cares about them?” Mr. Hashemi said. “All of the assumptions that informed U.S. policy toward the Middle East have now been upended by recent events. The question of Palestine is now back on the top of the regional agenda and the world agenda. I think this was the goal of the Hamas attack.” In recent months, Mr. Biden and his top aides have attempted to negotiate with both Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a complex three-way normalization deal by the end of the year. The new war will almost certainly throw off that timeline, but U.S. officials have been telling Saudi and Israeli officials in calls over the weekend that they are hopeful the discussions can continue. They are also watching Saudi reaction carefully and gauging whether Prince Mohammed might change his stance, especially if the Israeli military kills many Palestinian civilians in a Gaza offensive, which would ignite outrage across the Arab world. On Saturday, after the Hamas assault, the Saudi Foreign Ministry released a statement that did not explicitly denounce the attack and instead laid the blame on Israel, saying that the Saudi government had repeatedly warned “of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights and the repetition of systemic provocations against its sanctities.” The statement took Mr. Biden and several of his top aides by surprise, people with knowledge of the events said, and it angered American lawmakers who have supported the negotiations. One of those, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in an interview that he had spoken with a senior Saudi official on Saturday and said, “If you want a normal relationship with the United States, this is not a normal statement.” “You don’t want to be in the cheering section with Iran and Hezbollah,” he told them, as he recounted on Sunday. Mr. Graham said an Israeli official told him on Sunday that Israel wants to continue the normalization process because it would be a way to weaken Iran, the main supporter of Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group that fought a war with Israel in 2006. It is unclear whether Hamas carried out the attack in part to undermine the talks. A Hamas military commander did not cite the talks in a statement, though Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran are all opposed to any normalization with Israel. A Biden administration official said Saturday that it was too early to tell whether Iran had a hand in the operation. On Saturday, in a phone call with Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Blinken said the kingdom should clearly condemn the attack, a State Department official said. But in a description of the call, the Saudi Foreign Ministry did not include any criticism of the attack or of Hamas, and said only generically that civilians should not be targeted and stressed “the need for all parties to respect international humanitarian law.” Saudi officials appear to be taking a wait-and-see stance before continuing with the normalization efforts. Dennis Ross, who helped form Middle East policy for several U.S. presidents, said in an interview that he had spoken to a Saudi official after the attack, and that “for the moment, it is all on hold.” “There are two basic variables: the number of casualties and the atmosphere related to that, and second, if the Israelis come out of this looking like they have decimated Hamas as an organization,” he added. “The point is, in the next few weeks as Israel focuses on dealing with Hamas in Gaza — and whether it also faces Hezbollah in the north — the results may well determine whether the Saudis will want to go ahead.” Martin Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel, said the Israeli military response would complicate Prince Mohammed’s rapprochement with Israel. The images on social media of an Israeli offensive will “exacerbate the anger in the Arab world and I think particularly in Saudi Arabia,” he said during a call with reporters on Saturday arranged by the Council on Foreign Relations. “This is going to be very hard for Mohammed bin Salman to control.” The talks have so far centered on what Prince Mohammed is demanding from Mr. Biden: a mutual defense treaty, the building of a civilian nuclear program and access to more weapons. Although Prince Mohammed said in a Fox News interview last month that the Palestinian issue is “very important” and needs to be solved, he has not prioritized it in discussions with U.S. officials, including Mr. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, American officials said. For some experts, that is emblematic of the entire problem around these talks and the Abraham Accords. “While Jake Sullivan and Secretary Blinken have sold the accords as a magical formula for stability in the region, the only thing it will actually secure is strengthening — with an unprecedented U.S. security guarantee — an axis of dictatorships who will ally with Israel’s apartheid government and stay mum about the Palestinians,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the advocacy group Democracy for the Arab World Now. The group was founded by Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was murdered by Saudi agents in 2018. Although an Israeli government “will now be more able and more desperate to secure a deal with Saudi Arabia, it’s hard to imagine that even M.B.S.’ absolute rule can withstand moving forward with normalization now,” she said, using the initials of the Saudi prince. “It’s a good opportunity for the Biden team to reflect on their utterly failed approach to wheeling and dealing with autocrats as a road to stability in the Middle East.” In Saudi Arabia, some analysts have been skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing government would grant enough concessions to the Palestinians to satisfy the Saudi leadership. With a war starting, that is even less likely now. “The Kingdom is aware that the current extreme government in Israel cannot deliver on the issue of peace,” said Hesham Alghannam, a Saudi political scientist. “In reality, Israel was not really ready to reach an agreement with the Palestinians that would give them the minimum of their needs.” Abdulaziz Alghashian, a Saudi researcher who studies Saudi foreign policy toward Israel, said that any normalization agreements would not end the enmity of Arabs toward Israel as long as the Palestinian issue remains unresolved. “Israeli integration into the region won’t happen, ever, without a settlement,” he said. “And the way it’s going, quite frankly, it’s just going to be in a perpetual war there that’s going to spill over. So I don’t see it.” '),(6,'Hamas Attack Raises Questions Over an Israeli Intelligence Failure','American and Israeli officials said none of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated assault.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/israel-hamas-intelligence.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:03:10 +0000','The devastating surprise attack by Hamas on Saturday represented an equally stunning intelligence failure by Israel that involved undetected warnings, overwhelmed missile defenses and a slow response by apparently unprepared military forces, former and current U.S. officials said. American officials said Hamas had achieved a complete tactical surprise, reflected in a death toll of at least 700 Israelis. The Palestinian militant group sent hundreds of fighters through breached walls, breaking through with bulldozers and then killing civilians and soldiers in shooting sprees that went on for hours. None of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated attack that required coordinated land, air and sea strikes, according to an Israeli defense official and American officials. While the attack also surprised many Western intelligence agencies, they do not track Hamas’s activities as closely as Israel or Egypt do. The success astounded American officials with experience in the region. Over the years, Israel has set up a network of electronic intercepts, sensors and human informants throughout Gaza, which is about half the area of New York’s five boroughs. Israel and its neighbors have in the past invested heavily in trying to track and block Hamas’s networks, often intercepting shipments of missile components. That past success has made all the more urgent a series of questions about Israel’s failures on Saturday. Why was Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, now a dozen years old, apparently overwhelmed by the barrage of inexpensive but deadly missiles at the opening of the attack? How did Hamas manage to build such a big arsenal of rockets and missiles without Israeli intelligence detecting the growing stockpile? Was Israel too focused on threats from Hezbollah and the West Bank, rather than focusing military and intelligence resources on Gaza? And why were so many Israeli forces on leave or distant from the southern border, allowing Hamas to overrun Israeli military bases near Gaza? Neither American nor Israeli officials would address the questions on Sunday. But clearly the answers could affect the reputation of Israel\'s military and intelligence agencies, and the political future of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Hamas has challenged the very fundamental concept of Israeli deterrence,” said Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., a retired Marine Corps general and former top American commander in the Middle East. “It can only be re-established with the application of overwhelming, shocking violence. And it is only getting started.” But as Mr. Netanyahu’s government retaliates, and deals with the reality that Hamas has taken scores of Israeli hostages, the question of what went wrong will go down in history alongside other such failures. The most famous one in Israeli history was 50 years ago this week, during the Yom Kippur War. Others likened the surprise to the Tet offensive of the Vietnam War or even the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Past rocket barrages by Hamas have been blunted in part by Israel’s missile defense system, known as the Iron Dome. But on Saturday the system appeared overwhelmed. Hamas was able to fire hundreds of missiles in rapid succession, potentially more than the system’s interceptors could handle. The Iron Dome is designed to protect population centers and does not shoot if it determines an incoming missile or rocket will land harmlessly. But it has a limited number of Tamir interceptors, and reloading the system can take time. Hamas, one former administration official said, appeared to have studied the system’s vulnerabilities. But the system has dealt effectively with large barrages before, former officials said, suggesting that new weapons fired by Hamas for the first time Saturday could be harder to intercept and may have also played a role. Hamas used a new missile system known as Rajum during the attack, and also employed small drones that dropped munitions on Israeli military positions, according to Janes, a defense and open-source intelligence firm. On Saturday, Hamas fired a wide variety of rocket and missile systems, both the new ones and older models. But almost all of its rockets and missiles are Iranian-designed weapons that are smuggled into Gaza as components then assembled covertly. Both Israel and Egypt try to monitor efforts to smuggle components, many originally from Iran, through the Sinai Peninsula and into Gaza through underground tunnels, according to former U.S. intelligence officials. In 2021, Israel reported destroying 62 miles of underground tunnels, and built underground barriers 65 yards deep. Egypt has also worked to seal tunnels between Gaza and the peninsula. But no barrier is perfect. And, in addition to underground and sea routes, missile and rocket components are smuggled through the legal crossings, the former officials said. Israel has typically used extensive human networks in Gaza and intercepts of electronic communications to generate warnings of potential attacks, according to former American officials. The fact that Israeli intelligence was caught off-guard by the strikes suggests that before Saturday’s attacks, Hamas fighters avoided discussing the plans over mobile phones or other means of communications that could be intercepted. Hamas likely used old-school face-to-face planning to avoid Israeli detection. But hundreds of people must have been involved, demonstrating that Hamas’s efforts to break Israel’s network of informants has been successful, according to the former officials. Though it is shocking that Israel missed the preparations for the attack, said Beth Sanner, a former senior American intelligence official, she added that few spy agencies are as good at learning from their mistakes as Israel’s. “Because intelligence collection is a human endeavor, failure is inevitable,” she said. “Unfortunately it has happened at the most consequential time, when they are facing the most consequential threat in a half a century.” In retrospect, some believe the Israelis made erroneous assumptions about the nature of the threat from Hamas. “What people don’t understand is that while Hamas was treated as a terrorist organization, there were decisions made by Israel to make life easier for Gazans,” said Thomas Nides, the former American ambassador to Israel, who left Jerusalem this summer. “They issued 15,000 work permits, for workers in Gaza who came into Israel each day, and I believe there was a view that Hamas would not screw that up.” “Which clearly was wrong,” Mr. Nides added. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt, since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory. Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have also been surging for months, as have warnings of the risk of all-out war. Most of the recent focus has been on the occupied West Bank, where recurring Israeli military operations have sparked frequent gun battles with Palestinian militants. Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have also fought smaller tit-for-tat engagements. And American intelligence officials were clearly worried that trouble was brewing. This spring, William J. Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, warned that tensions between Israelis and Palestinians were threatening to bubble over again, despite the diplomatic progress in the region. But Israel appeared more focused on the West Bank as a potential source of an attack, rather than Gaza.  Experts cautioned that there was still much to learn about what precisely Israeli intelligence knew, and what warning signs were missed. And the same question can be asked about Egypt and other Arab governments that have no love for Hamas, and often quietly share intelligence with Israel. “While overall this is an intelligence failure, just how and in what way remains to be seen,” said Lewis Smart, the lead Middle East analyst with Janes, the defense intelligence firm. A key question American intelligence agencies were wrestling with over the weekend was the involvement of Iran in supplying Hamas and encouraging or even planning the attack. It is plausible that Iran could have played a role, American officials said, but that exact role is not yet clear. For Iran, its alliance with Hamas is a key point of leverage. Tehran, according to current and former officials, wants to derail the emerging peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Any war between Israel and Hamas that causes significant civilian casualties on both sides would make any such public peace incredibly difficult. “You have to ask yourself who benefits from this,” said General McKenzie. “Well Iran does because it pushes a wedge between Israel and the Saudis.” '),(7,'After Hamas Attack, U.S. to Send Weapons and Warships to Support Israel','The moves were designed by the Biden administration to reassure Israelis of the United States’ commitment, despite months of tension between Mr. Biden and Israel’s prime minister.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/israel-aid-pentagon-us-hamas.html','Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:08:06 +0000','The Pentagon announced on Sunday that it was sending additional munitions to Israel and moving Navy warships closer to the country in a show of support, a day after Palestinian militants launched one of the broadest invasions on Israeli territory in 50 years. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said he had ordered the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford and five guided-missile cruisers and destroyers, which are already in the Mediterranean Sea, to the eastern part of the sea, near Israel. Officials said the ships were en route but would take a few days to arrive. Mr. Austin also said the United States was increasing the number of Air Force fighter jets and attack planes in the region to “bolster regional deterrence efforts.” The assistance “underscores the United States’ ironclad support for the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli people,” Mr. Austin said in a statement. Mr. Austin’s announcement came as President Biden assured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a call Sunday morning that military assistance was on its way and more would follow. The promise of military might was designed by the Biden administration to reassure Israelis of the United States’ commitment to their security and to demonstrate resolve to Hamas and Israel’s other adversaries in the region. It comes despite months of tension between Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu over disagreements about the prime minister’s pursuit of judicial reforms that many Israelis say are undemocratic. In the call, Mr. Biden “discussed the taking of hostages by Hamas terrorists, including entire families, the elderly and young children,” according to a description of the call by the White House. “The president emphasized that there is no justification whatsoever for terrorism, and all countries must stand united in the face of such brutal atrocities,” the statement added. Pentagon officials said the deployment of additional forces was meant to deter Iran, Syria and any country or militant group from joining the conflict, as well as to provide enough ships, warplanes and other weaponry to protect Americans and American interests in the region. Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the head of the military’s Central Command, said in a statement on Sunday that his force “stands firmly with our Israeli and regional partners to address the risks of any party seeking to expand the conflict.” A senior Biden administration official said just hours after the attacks that the United States did not have intelligence that Iran was directly involved in planning the assault on Israel. But the official, who requested anonymity to discuss diplomatic and military planning, said Iran had long been deeply connected to Hamas, offering it financial support and military equipment. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday morning that the Israeli government had “asked for some specific additional assistance” as the country gears up for what Mr. Netanyahu has warned will be a prolonged conflict. Mr. Austin said the Biden administration would supply the Israeli armed forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions. U.S. officials declined to be more specific about particular weapons systems, but independent analysts said Israel would likely request more interceptors for its Iron Dome missile defense system as well as bombs and missiles for attack planes. American officials said on Sunday that they were also working through plans to evacuate thousands of Americans from Israel if necessary in what is called a “noncombatant evacuation.” Pentagon officials emphasized that no decisions have been made but that they were working through options, including one that involves putting some Americans on the Navy ships to get them to safety. The United States already provides Israel more than $3 billion in military assistance every year, and Mr. Blinken said that much of the equipment from that funding is already “in the pipeline” to be sent to Israel. The Pentagon also has positioned stockpiles of arms and ammunition worth about $2 billion at about six sites throughout Israel. The stockpiles provide weapons and ammunition for the Pentagon to use in Middle East conflicts, and the United States has also allowed Israel access to the supplies in emergencies. Use of the stockpiles is set up in a “dual key” arrangement in which both countries sign off on their use. For instance, the Pentagon, with Israel’s permission, has tapped into the vast but little-known stockpile to help meet Ukraine’s dire need for artillery shells in the war with Russia. Officials said the United States took only 155-millimeter artillery shells from the Israel stockpiles for use in Ukraine, which military analysts say Israel would not use in its fight against Hamas. If the fighting in the Middle East widens, the amount of supplies in the stockpiles could become an issue, analysts said. Officials for the National Security Council declined to say whether the use of those stockpiles was under consideration. But Pentagon officials said on Sunday that discussions were underway to allow Israel to use them. In the longer term, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said Sunday that they hoped Republicans could resolve their leadership struggle and select a House speaker so that Congress can act on further funding for Israel if needed. “Given the situation in the Middle East with one of our closest allies in the world, it is critical that we bring this to a close expeditiously,” Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. Mr. Lawler and many of his Republican colleagues are fuming at the band of ultraconservative rebels who forced Speaker Kevin McCarthy out of his post last week, putting legislation and additional funding at risk. “It wasn’t my idea to oust the speaker, and I thought it was dangerous,” Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Sunday on CNN. “I look at the world and all the threats that are out there. What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can’t govern, when we’re dysfunctional, when we don’t even have a speaker of the House?” Lawmakers signaled there would be bipartisan support to provide more aid to Israel, but the House would first need to elect a new speaker. Last week, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida and seven other conservative lawmakers orchestrated Mr. McCarthy’s ouster, angry that he worked with Democrats last month to avoid a government shutdown. “There will likely be a need for some additional appropriations,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, said on CNN, adding, “Congress should certainly be prepared to do that sooner, rather than later.” Mr. Jeffries urged House Republicans to decide on a speaker. The two Republican candidates to replace Mr. McCarthy both pledged their support for more Israel aid. On Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said his first move as speaker would be to offer assistance. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said on social media: “Make no mistake: The United States will always stand with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East.” '),(8,'McCarthy Allies Criticize Far Right for Leaderless House as Israel Is Attacked','Several Republicans fumed at the rebels in their ranks for rendering Congress impotent at a time when legislation and additional funding could be needed to help Israel.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/house-speaker-israel-jordan-scalise.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 19:31:51 +0000','When a majority of House Republicans opposed a successful push by right-wing rebels to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, many warned that a leaderless House would be paralyzed to respond to a domestic or international crisis. Days later, Hamas militants attacked Israel in a brazen assault, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare, “We are at war.” Now, Republicans are fuming at the rebels in their ranks for rendering Congress impotent and ineffectual at a time when legislation and additional funding could be needed to help one of America’s closest allies. “It wasn’t my idea to oust the speaker, and I thought it was dangerous,” Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Sunday on CNN. “I look at the world and all the threats that are out there. What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can’t govern, when we’re dysfunctional, when we don’t even have a Speaker of the House?” Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, was even more direct, calling the removal of Mr. McCarthy “idiotic” and using a profanity to describe the “unmitigated” mess caused by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida and the other Republican rebels who joined with Democrats to remove Mr. McCarthy. “Uncertainty and chaos in the U.S. breeds vulnerability around the world,” Mr. Lawler wrote on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday. “The House should immediately reinstate McCarthy and stop screwing around.” Republicans were scrambling Sunday to determine who would become the next House speaker. Two leading candidates have emerged: Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Judiciary Committee chairman. Both men are seen as more conservative than Mr. McCarthy. Mr. Jordan, a co-founder of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, has the endorsement of former President Donald J. Trump. On Fox News, Mr. Jordan said Sunday that his first move as speaker would be to help Israel. “I want to give them what they need to win,” Mr. Jordan pledged on the show “Sunday Morning Futures.” Mr. Scalise also pledged full support. “Make no mistake: The United States will always stand with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East,” he wrote on social media. “They must defend themselves as their citizens are slaughtered by Hamas terrorists. They have our full support and our prayers.” The United States already provides Israel more than $3 billion in military assistance every year, but the House would need to elect a new speaker should more funds be needed. “There will likely be a need for some additional appropriations,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, said on CNN, adding, “Congress should certainly be prepared to do that sooner, rather than later.” Mr. Jeffries urged House Republicans to agree on a speaker so that “we can move forward to get the business of the American people done” both domestically and in support of Israel. Republicans plan to have a closed-door meeting Tuesday to hear from both candidates, with a floor vote expected on Wednesday. Aides have said the process could stretch out longer if Republicans fail to unite behind a candidate. Throughout the weekend, some of Mr. McCarthy’s staff members posted on social media, criticizing the hard-right members who removed their boss from his position. “Israel is at war,” Mr. McCarthy’s deputy spokesman, Chad Gilmartin, wrote on the X platform. “Americans have likely been killed and are being held hostage. Congress is essentially paralyzed without a House speaker.” Mr. Gaetz, who led the rebellion against Mr. McCarthy, rejected the idea that he had caused chaos and paralysis endangering the United States and its allies. He said he remained undecided on whether to back Mr. Jordan or Mr. Scalise, but said he would support whichever candidate a majority of Republicans backed. “I don’t think that other countries think about Kevin McCarthy’s speakership quite as much as Kevin McCarthy does,” Mr. Gaetz said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We’ll have a new speaker next week, and we’ll be prepared to do our work.” '),(9,'Nearly 1,000 Migrating Birds Die After Striking Chicago Building','At least 961 birds died in one night in Chicago after crashing into the windows of the McCormick Place Lakeside Center during the height of the fall migration.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/birds-dead-chicago-building.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 19:20:23 +0000','Millions of birds fly over Chicago during the fall migration season, and a number of them die after being confused by bright lights or after trying to fly through a window, but the carpet of bird carcasses outside a convention center on Thursday morning shocked people who have been monitoring birds in the city for decades. At least 961 dead birds were found outside the McCormick Place Lakeside Center, according to the Field Museum, a natural history museum about one mile north of the convention center. Volunteers and scientists at the museum go to the convention center, which overlooks Lake Michigan and has an exterior made mainly of glass, each day during the spring and fall migration seasons to search for birds that have clattered into the building overnight. The building, which has four levels, is not especially tall compared with nearby skyscrapers. Douglas Stotz, a senior conservation ecologist at the museum, said that he was “blown away” by how many birds were migrating on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, as well as by how many were found dead. “I’ve been in Chicago for 40 years and bird-watch all the time and I’ve never, ever seen anything like that,” he said on Sunday. Mr. Stotz said that the number of birds that strike the convention center each day varies. The previous record had been around 200 dead birds. Some days, no birds die. The nearly 1,000 dead birds found on Thursday were the most the museum had recorded in the four decades that it has been keeping track, he said. Mr. Stotz said that a large number of birds were migrating that night because their travel had been delayed by unfavorable weather conditions. Before Wednesday night, the temperature had been unusually high and the birds encountered a headwind. When the temperatures dropped and the wind shifted, a huge number of birds took advantage of the improved conditions and flew over Chicago, which is in Cook County. Around 3:40 a.m. on Thursday, about 1.49 million birds were in flight above Cook County, according to BirdCast, a bird migration tracking project by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Colorado State University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Around this time, a small storm system moved through the city. “The birds hit this storm and they drop out, they don’t want to fly through the storm,” Mr. Stotz said. “So they come down to the ground, and that sets up the conditions for the incredible migration we saw — and for the big kill we saw.” Birds are confused by lights and windows, which they don’t know they can’t fly through. It is a problem in all cities. Between 365 million and 988 million birds are killed annually by striking buildings in the United States, according to a 2014 study by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. At the Field Museum, dead birds are turned over to a flesh-eating beetle colony that cleans the birds so that their skeletal remains can be added to the museum’s collection and used for research. Mr. Stotz said that the high concentration of dead birds found on Thursday should emphasize how important it is for buildings to turn off their lights during bird migration season. He also hopes it will move building owners to opt for windows that are less reflective or more opaque, which are safer for birds. In a statement, McCormick Place said that it was “truly saddened by this incident” and described its efforts to reduce bird window strikes, including participating in Lights Out Chicago, a program managed by the Chicago Audubon Society that encourages building owners to turn off or dim decorative lights. The statement said that lights at the complex are turned off unless they are needed for workers and visitors. There had been an event during the week of the bird strikes, so the lights were sometimes on, the statement said. “We deeply appreciate our community’s concern for the welfare of birds and your engagement with our efforts to mitigate these issues, and we are in discussion with industry experts to look for better solutions to protect our avian neighbors,” the statement said. A large number of dead birds were also found on Thursday in other parts of downtown Chicago, said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors. Ms. Prince told WGN Radio that the group on Thursday found about 300 injured birds and about 700 to 800 dead birds in the square mile it monitored. Outside some buildings, the group found more than 100 dead or injured birds, which she said “was a very unusual and tragic occurrence.” '),(10,'Why Puerto Rico Is Adding ‘USA’ to Its Driver’s Licenses','Puerto Ricans have long been wrongly told that their driver’s licenses are not proof that they are American but some question whether the change will resolve much.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/puerto-rico-drivers-license-usa.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 13:00:13 +0000','Humberto Marchand turned on his phone camera and began recording inside the airport in May because he could not believe what he was hearing. The subsequent video was posted on social media and showed an employee of Hertz, the rental car chain, refusing to give Mr. Marchand his prepaid reserved car because he had presented a driver’s license issued from Puerto Rico, where he is from. The employee did not realize that this meant he was American and ignored Mr. Marchand’s pleas as he repeated, “It is a valid ID.” Eileen Vélez Vega, Puerto Rico’s secretary of transportation and public works, felt increasingly frustrated as she watched that video in the spring, which reignited concerns over how Puerto Ricans are treated in the United States and the way their colonial past still vexes the island. “I was shocked about how much lack of education, lack of knowledge was out there,” Ms. Vélez Vega said in an interview, noting that people born in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, have the same birthright American citizenship as people born in the 50 states. “I couldn’t believe what was happening.” Ms. Vélez Vega and her department made calls to the United States Department of Homeland Security over the summer to discuss a possible solution. On Tuesday, Puerto Rico’s government revealed its plan: Driver’s licenses will now read “Puerto Rico USA” on the top, an addition that officials hope will minimize issues when Puerto Ricans are traveling in the mainland United States. There have been several high-profile cases this year of Puerto Ricans being wrongly told that their licenses are not really proof of American citizenship, with many of those instances gaining attention because of reporting from CBS: A Puerto Rican family flying home from Los Angeles was asked for passports because the airline employee appeared to be unaware that the island was U.S. territory. In another case, a Puerto Rican man was not allowed to buy an engagement ring in California because a jewelry chain worker didn’t accept his Puerto Rican driver’s license as valid ID. Roberto Cruz, the managing attorney of the southeast office of LatinoJustice, said that “it is unfortunate that the Puerto Rican government has felt it is necessary to include the ‘USA’ stamp, but if it is helpful for Puerto Ricans to get decent treatment and the services they deserve, then we support it.” Still, in an island that has had a complicated and at times charged relationship with the United States ever since it was annexed in 1898, after the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War, even the slightest change can trigger political questions that have been raised for more than a century: What, exactly, is Puerto Rico’s relationship to the United States, and what does sovereignty for the island mean in the future? Many residents of Puerto Rico have long viewed the island’s status as a colonial territory as untenable, debating the pros and cons of statehood, being a commonwealth and independence, said Charles R. Venator-Santiago, a professor of Latino politics and law at the University of Connecticut. Puerto Rico has held six nonbinding plebiscites on whether it should become a state, most recently in 2020, when 52 percent of voters on the island endorsed the move. Turnout has often been low, amid boycotts by critics who support the status quo, or the smaller faction that seeks independence. Those dynamics have turned a seemingly mundane tweak on driver’s licenses into an emblem of the push for statehood, Professor Venator-Santiago said. Beyond the political implications, some doubt that the USA label — which other territories like Guam also have on driver’s licenses — will even prevent mishaps in the states. One of those doubters, Mario Pabon, of Carolina, P.R., recalled that an older version of the Puerto Rican license that had an American flag printed on top did not help him avoid prejudice or embarrassing situations. Around a decade ago, when he was in his forties, Mr. Pabon said he went with friends to a bar in San Diego, when an employee asked him for identification. Mr. Pabon pulled out his Puerto Rican license emblazoned with the American flag. “You have to show us your passport,” Mr. Pabon recalled the worker telling him. His passport was back home. The bar did not let him in that night, he said. If Puerto Ricans could write across their licenses that they are valid proof that they’re American, many “still won’t get it,” Mr. Pabon said. Andrew J. Padilla, a doctoral fellow studying governance at New York University who is Puerto Rican, said that having “USA” on an ID “doesn’t combat ignorance.” A 2017 poll showed that only a slim majority of Americans realize Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Ms. Vélez Vega, of the Puerto Rican transportation department, said that there is a need to “educate further and to provide more orientation for folks outside of Puerto Rico” so they know the identifications are valid. While the issue is not new, she said, the change this month was ultimately prompted because those problems were “getting more public and more frequent.” In 2019, José Guzmán Payano, 24, showed a Puerto Rican license to a CVS employee when trying to get over-the-counter cold medicine. But the employee asked about Mr. Payano’s immigration status and then for a visa before denying him the medication. Mr. Payano said in an interview that the new USA addition on licenses “is a really great idea because this clears a lot of doubt that people may have with the ID.” Similar confusion goes back decades. Christina D. Ponsa-Kraus, a professor of legal history at Columbia Law School who has researched American territorial expansion, said that her mother was pulled over in Virginia in the 1960s and given a ticket for driving without a license even though she had a valid Puerto Rico driver’s license. “This sort of thing is just one among innumerable forms of discrimination, large and small, that Puerto Ricans have suffered because Puerto Rico is a colony,” Professor Ponsa-Kraus said. Some Puerto Rican advocacy organizations see some value in the new label, though they warned against believing it would totally solve the issue. Surey Miranda, a co-founder of Diaspora For Puerto Rico, a nonprofit that aims to empower and support the Puerto Rican community, said that anything that can improve the way Puerto Ricans navigate services “is of course going to be welcome,” but a deeper problem will still persist: the “second-class citizenship idea.” That idea relates to how Puerto Ricans who reside on the island cannot vote in general elections and how they aren’t entitled to some federal benefits. Vanessa Díaz, a professor of Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University who researches Puerto Rican culture and politics, said that discussions over the new driver’s licenses underscore a “general ignorance around Puerto Rico and the reality of contemporary U.S. colonialism.” And the cases that have gained national attention highlight yet another issue that may not be solved by adding “USA” on identification, Professor Díaz said: Latinos of all kinds “are constantly treated as foreigners regardless of citizenship, whether you’re an eighth-generation Mexican American, or a recent immigrant from anywhere in Latin America, or a Puerto Rican who lives in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.” For Mr. Marchand, who had the incident with Hertz earlier this year, the new licenses are a “step in a right direction,” he said. Mr. Marchand said he is proud that his story has led to some change, though he believes others will always find reasons to doubt a Puerto Rican’s legitimate status as an American citizen. “I knew I wasn’t the only one,” Mr. Marchand said of his experience. “This has got to end.” '),(11,'Biden Allies Try to Squash Third-Party Candidates','With Democrats worried that a third-party bid could throw a tight race to Donald Trump, President Biden’s top aides have blessed a broad offensive to starve such efforts of cash and ballot access.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/biden-trump-third-parties-no-labels.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 14:37:01 +0000','Powerful allies of President Biden are aggressively working to stop third-party and independent presidential candidacies, fearing that an outside bid could cost Democrats an election that many believe will again come down to a few percentage points in key battleground states. As attempts to mount outside campaigns multiply, a broad coalition has accelerated a multipronged assault to starve such efforts of financial and political support and warn fellow Democrats that supporting outsider candidacies, including the centrist organization No Labels, could throw the election to former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden’s top aides have blessed the multimillion-dollar offensive, which cuts across the party, tapping the resources of the Democratic National Committee, labor unions, abortion rights groups, top donors and advocacy groups backing moderate and liberal Democrats. Even the president has helped spread the word: Mr. Biden, in an interview with ProPublica, said a No Labels candidacy would “help the other guy.” The endeavor is far-reaching. In Washington, Democratic allies are working alongside top party strategists to spread negative information about possible outsider candidates. Across the country, lawyers have begun researching moves to limit ballot access — or at least make it more costly to qualify. At expensive resorts and closed-door conferences, Democratic donors are urging their friends not to fund potential spoiler candidates. And in key swing states, lone-wolf operators, including a librarian from Arizona, are trying their own tactics to make life difficult for third-party contenders. The anxiety over candidates and parties traditionally consigned to the fringes of American politics reflects voters’ deep dissatisfaction with both men who are likely to become the major parties’ nominees. No third-party candidate has risen out of the single digits in three decades, since Ross Perot captured nearly a fifth of the vote in 1992. Given the devotion of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters, Democrats fear that most of the attrition would come from Mr. Biden’s fragile coalition. “They’ve got to understand the risk that they are exposing the country to by doing this,” said Richard A. Gephardt, a former House majority leader and a Democratic Party graybeard who has formed a super PAC to attack outsider campaigns. “This is too dangerous of an idea to put in play in this context, in this year. These are not normal times.” Mr. Gephardt warned that third-party candidates threatened not only Mr. Biden’s chances of victory but also the stability of American democracy. Internal polling conducted by his group found that an independent centrist candidate could attract more than 20 percent of the vote in competitive states, helping Mr. Trump in all but one of them. In recent days, two candidates have taken steps toward mounting independent bids. Cornel West, the left-wing Harvard professor, announced on Thursday that he would run as an independent candidate. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has hinted that he may announce on Monday that he is leaving the Democratic presidential primary race to run as an independent. Already, a super PAC backing his bid has raised $17 million, according to Tony Lyons, the group’s treasurer. Still, most of the Biden allies’ attention is directed at No Labels, the best-funded outsider organization, which after years of sponsoring bipartisan congressional caucuses is working to gain ballot access for a presidential candidate for the first time. The group’s chief executive, Nancy Jacobson, has told potential donors and allies that the No Labels candidate will be a moderate Republican, according to three people familiar with the conversations. That decision would rule out Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat whose flirtation with the idea has prompted a wave of angst within his party. No Labels has already raised $60 million, Ms. Jacobson said in an interview, and has qualified for the ballot in 11 states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina. The group plans to spend about half of the money on securing ballot access across all 50 states. Ms. Jacobson said her organization was devoted to presenting voters with an option beyond Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump. No Labels is in the process of vetting potential candidates now and will announce its delegate selection process in the coming weeks, she said. The plan is to hold a nominating convention in April in Dallas and anoint a presidential ticket if it is clear the country is heading toward a 2020 rematch. Ms. Jacobson and her chief strategist, Ryan Clancy, insist that their effort is in good faith and is not a secret plot to help Mr. Trump win. “We’re never going to be a party to something that would spoil it for Trump,” Mr. Clancy said. No Labels has focused its recent polling on eight states that are expected to be competitive in a Biden-Trump contest, though Mr. Clancy said he believed a No Labels ticket would be viable in 25 states. If a third-party or independent candidate were to gain serious traction, it could reshuffle the entire presidential map, potentially turning states like New York or Texas into true battlegrounds. Mr. Kennedy has also been a source of concern for Democrats, who worry that his anti-corporate politics and famous last name could pull some of their voters away from Mr. Biden. But some of Mr. Biden’s top allies also believe that Mr. Kennedy, who has increasingly pushed right-wing ideas, would hurt Mr. Trump. The broad Democratic unease is rooted in a core belief that Mr. Trump has both a low ceiling and a high floor of general-election support — meaning that his voters are less likely to be swayed by a third-party or independent candidate. Mr. Biden has wider appeal, but his supporters are not as loyal, and polling has suggested that they could be persuaded to back someone else if given more options. Public and private surveys point to increased interest in alternatives this election. In polling released this week by Monmouth University, majorities of voters said that they were not enthusiastic about Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden being at the top of their party’s ticket and that they would not back either man if the race became a rematch. Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the center-left group Third Way who is serving as a clearinghouse for Democrats’ effort to block third-party and independent candidates, is working with the progressive organization MoveOn and a host of like-minded Biden allies to dissuade anyone from having any association with No Labels. Those efforts are bankrolled by more than $1 million from Reid Hoffman, the billionaire Democratic megadonor. Mr. Bennett is using Third Way’s connections with centrist donors to try to block No Labels’ access to money, while Rahna Epting, the executive director of MoveOn, has been briefing other progressive groups and labor unions about the dangers of their members’ supporting third-party candidates instead of Mr. Biden. “Anything that divides the anti-Trump coalition is bad,” Mr. Bennett said. Marc Elias, one of the party’s most dogged and litigious election lawyers, has been retained by American Bridge, the Democratic Party’s primary opposition research organization, to vet ballot-qualification efforts by No Labels and other third-party efforts. And the Democratic National Committee has instructed state and county party leaders to say nothing in public about No Labels, according to an email the Utah Democratic Party sent to county leaders in the state. “We need to do everything we can to stop this effort NOW, and not wait until they name a ticket and this becomes a runaway train,” Thom DeSirant, the executive director of the Utah Democratic Party, wrote in a missive that included links to Third Way’s talking points about how to speak about No Labels. The efforts resemble hand-to-hand political combat in both public and private. The abortion rights group Reproductive Freedom for All wrote on social media that Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a Republican former governor of Utah who has been linked to the No Labels bid, is an “abortion extremist,” based on anti-abortion views he articulated during his 2012 presidential campaign. And Michael Steele, who served as a lieutenant governor of Maryland and as Republican National Committee chairman, has assumed the portfolio of persuading former Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a moderate Republican who has publicly toyed with accepting the No Labels nomination, to end his association with the group. “I’ve told the governor what I think he should do,” Mr. Steele said. Perhaps nowhere has No Labels run into as many real-world roadblocks as in Arizona. After the group successfully qualified for the presidential ballot, the Arizona Democratic Party sued to remove it. That legal effort failed, but the attention led two people to submit candidate statements to run for down-ballot offices on the No Labels ticket — something the group had tried to block so as to avoid being categorized as a political party, which could trigger requirements to disclose No Labels donors, who have so far been kept secret. For different reasons, the Arizona candidates who are seeking the No Labels line could prove awkward for the movement. One of them, Tyson Draper, a high school coach from Thatcher, Ariz., is seeking the group’s line to run for the Senate. In an interview last week, he called himself a centrist political newcomer who had never sought public office before. A day later, he filed papers to begin a movement to recall Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat. The other would-be No Labeler is Richard Grayson, an assistant librarian at a community college south of Phoenix. Mr. Grayson, 72, is seeking the No Labels nomination for the state’s Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities. He has appeared as a candidate for office dozens of times since 1982, and said he was a Biden supporter. “I’m a perennial candidate whose goal is to torture No Labels,” he said. “I’m enjoying it immensely. I’m tormenting them.” '),(12,'Chocolate Maker Did Not Evacuate Workers Before Deadly Blast, OSHA Says','A chocolate maker faces more than $44,400 in penalties for violations connected to an explosion that killed seven people at a Pennsylvania factory in March, regulators said.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/rm-palmer-chocolate-factory-explosion.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:35:01 +0000','A chocolate manufacturer, R.M. Palmer Company, failed to evacuate a Pennsylvania factory after some employees reported smelling gas before an explosion leveled part of the plant in March, killing seven workers, a federal official said this week. “Seven workers will never return home because the R.M. Palmer Co. did not evacuate the facility after being told of a suspected gas leak,” Kevin T. Chambers, an area director with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Pennsylvania, said in a news release on Thursday. “Ensuring the safety of a workplace is expected of employers and required by law,” he added. “The company could have prevented this horrific tragedy by following required safety procedures.” In a statement on Friday, the company called his remarks “inflammatory, callous and irresponsible.” “R.M. Palmer stands by its safety program and policies and has already contested the OSHA citations in this matter,” the company said. “The company disputes each of the citations and contends that the agency had no basis to issue these citations as stated.” OSHA imposed $44,483 in penalties against R.M. Palmer for not evacuating the plant, not clearly marking emergency exit signs, improperly splicing cords and for several record-keeping violations. The agency said it had been investigating reports that workers complained of a gas smell before the March 24 explosion at the plant in West Reading, Pa., a borough of about 4,500 residents roughly 65 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The blast, which happened around 5 p.m., flattened a two-story factory building and damaged another. Seven people were killed. Eleven others were injured and three families living in a nearby apartment were displaced, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the blast. N.T.S.B. investigators determined that the explosion involved two gas leaks from service fittings to a gas line adjacent to the factory installed by UGI, a natural gas and utility company that serves Pennsylvania.  A representative for UGI could not be immediately reached on Saturday night. In a statement days after the explosion, the company said, “We take our responsibility seriously, and we are working with local authorities and state and federal agencies to determine the cause of the incident.” R.M. Palmer pointed to the N.T.S.B. findings from the ongoing investigation to rebut the OSHA citations, which the company said were “predicated upon a ‘leak’ inside of a Palmer building.” A July N.T.S.B. investigation update, the company said, “contains no reference to any natural gas leak inside any Palmer building.” “Until the N.T.S.B.’s investigation is complete, there is simply no basis to evaluate OSHA’s statement that an evacuation would have prevented the seven tragic deaths that occurred,” the statement continued. Last month, the N.T.S.B. revealed that its investigation had hit a snag. The agency announced it had subpoenaed the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, which oversees UGI, and removed the state agency as an investigative partner after the commission failed to obtain and provide unredacted inspection and investigation reports from UGI. R.M. Palmer, which was founded in 1948, is known for making seasonal chocolates, including Easter chocolate bunnies. It employs around 850 people, according to its website. About 35 office staff members and 70 factory employees were inside the two buildings at the time of the blast, officials said. The N.T.S.B. is expected to complete its investigation “likely sometime next year,” according to R.M. Palmer, which said it was continuing to cooperate with the inquiry. '),(13,'Biden’s Hopes for the Middle East Imperiled by Eruption of Violence','The Hamas attack on Israel could narrow the chances for the president’s efforts to negotiate a new alignment in the region by normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/biden-middle-east-diplomacy.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 23:55:44 +0000','For months, the Biden administration has been pursuing an ambitious diplomatic project to design a new Middle East for a new era. But the old Middle East, it turns out, still has something to say about it. The stunning Hamas assault on Israel on Saturday served as a gut-wrenching reminder that the decades-old conflict with Palestinians remains a cancer that has not gone away even as leaders in Washington, Jerusalem, Riyadh and other Arab capitals would prefer to focus on building a revamped region. American officials said it was too early to say whether the attack was explicitly motivated by a desire by Hamas or its patron Iran to disrupt President Biden’s effort to broker a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that would profoundly reorient the Middle East. But they acknowledged that it could complicate the already delicate negotiations and make it that much harder to reach an agreement akin to the Abraham Accords between Israel and smaller Arab nations. “This will slow considerably if not kill the Saudi Abraham Accords deal,” said Mara Rudman, a former Middle East peace diplomat under President Barack Obama. “It strikes at the heart of key elements for Saudi entry, a pathway forward for Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza,” she added. “And on the Israeli side, there will be zero appetite across a wide political spectrum for helping Palestinians, despite the fact that so doing could actually enhance, not detract from, Israeli security.” In the short term, at least, Mr. Biden’s sweeping aspirations will have to take a back seat to managing the clash now consuming Israel and Gaza, one unlikely to be resolved as quickly as the bursts of violence that have periodically erupted over the years. The Hamas strike represented the most extensive invasion of Israeli territory in decades, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel compelled to send ground forces into Gaza to exact retribution and rescue hostages. In a brief televised statement on Saturday, Mr. Biden condemned the Hamas attack as “unconscionable” and called his support for Israel’s right to defend itself “rock solid and unwavering.” He warned against escalation by unnamed others, almost certainly meaning Iran. “This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage,” he said. But as he huddled with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and other advisers at the White House and consulted long distance with Mr. Netanyahu and King Abdullah II of Jordan, Mr. Biden did not indicate publicly how far he thought Israel should go in responding to the attack, nor did he speculate on how it would affect his broader goals for the region. The president’s Republican opponents wasted no time turning the conflict in Israel into an attack line against Mr. Biden. Led by former President Donald J. Trump, Republicans asserted that the administration’s recent hostage deal with Iran had enabled Hamas’s actions. “Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. In fact, no American taxpayer dollars were involved in the hostage deal. The Biden administration signed off on the release of $6 billion of Iranian oil revenue frozen in South Korea and decreed that it be kept in a bank in Qatar available only for humanitarian purposes. Officials said Saturday that none of that money had been spent. The crisis nonetheless underscored how quickly things can blow up in a volatile region. Just last week, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, noted at The Atlantic Festival that “the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” a comment quickly recycled on Saturday by the Republican National Committee. But what the Republicans did not highlight was that Mr. Sullivan had made sure to add a caveat, saying, “I emphasize ‘for now’ because all of that can change.” And change it did on Saturday. For years, the Palestinian issue had largely receded from the global agenda. But it never receded for the millions living in Gaza and the West Bank, where anger and resentment at Israeli controls and settlements remain combustible. The scale of the Hamas incursion and the inevitable magnitude of the Israeli response will put it back on the front burner for the foreseeable future. And national security veterans predicted it would push it to the center of the discussions of a new Middle East. Until now, the Palestinian conflict was deemed something of a secondary issue in the talks that Mr. Biden’s envoys have conducted with the Saudis, one that had to be addressed to smooth the larger rapprochement but that was not the heart of the deal. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cares little about the Palestinian cause but his father, King Salman, does and so the prince has made clear that Israel must make some concessions as part of any agreement. The larger impetus of the talks has been forging a broad alignment against Iran, cementing the Saudi-American alliance and preventing China from making further inroads into the region. Prince Mohammed has sought a mutual defense treaty with the United States and cooperation on developing civilian nuclear energy. Mr. Netanyahu has suggested that normalizing relations with the leading Arab power would transform Israel’s place in the region. The possibility of an Iranian role in Saturday’s attack quickly generated speculation. A senior Biden administration official, who could not be identified under White House ground rules, told reporters that the United States did not have anything to indicate that Iran was involved but noted that Hamas would not exist without Iranian support. A former administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to be more candid, said Iranian influence over Palestinian militants had grown over the past year in both Gaza and the West Bank. For months, the official said, Tehran has seen an opportunity to stir the pot by encouraging violence between Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank. “In the past few weeks, as the Israeli-Saudi normalization process has proceeded forward, the rhetoric from Iran has become much harsher,” said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Traditionally, Iran has relied on its proxies and rejectionist forces to disrupt regional trends it dislikes.” “Hamas is an independent actor with its own agenda,” he added. “But it has maintained close ties to Iran. Given the scale of this attack, I am not sure it was done without an Iranian foreknowledge — not necessarily consent, although they would readily agree.” John Hannah, a national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney and a senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, said it seemed “highly probable to me” that the attack had origins in Iran and Lebanon, the base of Hezbollah, with the goal of “derailing the momentum toward peace” between Israel and Saudi Arabia. “Israel-Saudi normalization poses a mortal threat to the genocidal project that lies at the core of the Iranian revolution: wiping Israel off the map,” Mr. Hannah said. By whipping up conflict, “Hamas and its Iranian and Hezbollah backers are no doubt hoping to use the pain and deaths of their own people to inflame hatred of Israel across the Middle East, including the streets of Arabia, thereby making it impossible for the peace train between Riyadh and Jerusalem to pick up more speed.” The Saudi reaction to the Hamas incursion on Saturday disappointed Israel and its supporters. A statement released by the foreign ministry did not condemn the attacks but instead noted that the Saudis had long warned about “the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights.” If the war proves to be a prolonged one, it could narrow the room for both Saudis and Israelis to make a deal. If the Israelis use overwhelming force in Gaza, the Saudis may feel pressured to make critical statements that limit their bargaining space and raise the cost that Israel would have to pay for a normalization deal. Likewise, the war will galvanize hard-liners in Mr. Netanyahu’s government to resist any agreement making concessions to the Palestinians. But administration officials said the talks were still months away from their final stage and that it was premature to assume they would be thwarted. Mr. Hannah agreed, adding that Prince Mohammed, known by his initials, M.B.S., despises Hamas and has told associates that he was aware that there could be violence to try to stop progress with the United States and Israel. “It may throw some hiccups into the diplomatic efforts between Israel and the Saudis, but it won’t destroy a process that M.B.S. is convinced will best serve Saudi national interests,” Mr. Hannah said. “As the saying goes, the dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.” '),(14,'Trump and Other GOP Candidates Use Israel-Gaza to Criticize Biden','Republicans renewed their opposition to President Biden’s decision to unfreeze $6 billion for humanitarian purposes as part of recent hostage release negotiations.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/republicans-israel-iran-hamas.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:23:39 +0000','Republican presidential candidates seized on the Hamas attack on Israel Saturday to try to lay blame on President Biden, drawing a connection between the surprise assault and a recent hostage release deal between the United States and Iran, a longtime backer of the group. Former President Donald J. Trump, who has frequently presented himself as a unflinching ally of Israel and who moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in 2018, blamed Mr. Biden for the conflict. While campaigning on Saturday in Waterloo, Iowa, he said the attacks had occurred because “we are perceived as being weak and ineffective, with a really weak leader.” On several occasions, Mr. Trump went further, saying that the hostage deal was a catalyst of the attacks. “The war happened for two reasons,” he said. “The United States is giving — and gave to Iran — $6 billion over hostages.” In exchange for the release of five Americans held in Tehran, the Biden administration agreed in August to free up $6 billion in frozen Iranian oil revenue funds for humanitarian purposes. The administration has emphasized that the money could be used only for “food, medicine, medical equipment that would not have a dual military use.” A senior Biden administration official responded to the comments by Mr. Trump — as well as to criticism by other Republican candidates — by calling them “total lies” and accusing the politicians of having either a “complete misunderstanding” of the facts or of participating willingly in a “complete mischaracterization and disinformation of facts.” Another Biden administration official, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement, “These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today, and this is not the time to spread disinformation.” Mr. Trump, the G.O.P. front-runner, was not alone in assailing Mr. Biden, as the entire Republican field weighed in on the attacks on Saturday. In a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida faulted the Biden administration for its foreign policy decisions in the Middle East. “Iran has helped fund this war against Israel, and Joe Biden’s policies that have gone easy on Iran has helped to fill their coffers,” he said. “Israel is now paying the price for those policies.” In a statement issued through the White House, Mr. Biden pledged solidarity with Israel and said that he had spoken with Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s prime minister. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel,” Mr. Biden said. Yet while the G.O.P. candidates rallied around Israel on Saturday, there is a divide in the party between foreign policy hawks and those who favor a more isolationist approach. In addition to criticizing Mr. Biden on Saturday, former Vice President Mike Pence had harsh words for fellow Republicans who prefer a more hands-off approach to conflicts abroad. “This is what happens when @POTUS projects weakness on the world stage, kowtows to the mullahs in Iran with a $6 Billion ransom, and leaders in the Republican Party signal American retreat as Leader of the Free World,” Mr. Pence wrote on X. “Weakness arouses evil.” Other Republican candidates, including Nikki Haley, who was an ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Trump, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina denounced the attacks as acts of terrorism. “Make no mistake: Hamas is a bloodthirsty terrorist organization backed by Iran and determined to kill as many innocent lives as possible,” Ms. Haley said in a statement. Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey echoed the criticism of his Republican rivals in a social media post, calling the release of $6 billion by the Biden administration to Iran “idiotic.” Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Mr. Hutchinson similarly sought to connect the attack with the release of humanitarian funds for Iran. Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur, called the attacks “barbaric and medieval” in a post on X. “Shooting civilians and kidnapping children are war crimes,” he wrote. “Israel’s right to exist & defend itself should never be doubted and Iran-backed Hamas & Hezbollah cannot be allowed to prevail.” '),(15,'Stoneman Willie Gets a Proper Burial and a Name','Stoneman Willie, as he is known, was a legend in Reading, where his remains were on display for generations. On Saturday, the city revealed his real name and gave him a proper send-off.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/stoneman-willie-buried-pennsylvania.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 19:51:31 +0000','For 128 years, he has been known only as Stoneman Willie, a figure lying in an open coffin in a Reading, Pa., funeral home, leathery and as hardened as his nickname suggests. Little was known about him, other than he was picked up while drunkenly walking the streets of Reading one night in October 1895 and again, days later, for breaking into a boardinghouse. A prison warden noted that he stood 5-foot-11 and had sandy brown hair and a mustache. Willie appears to have lived at life’s margins but became a legend in death. Generations of schoolchildren and other visitors have paid their respects at the Theo C. Auman Inc. Funeral Home, which has cared for Willie’s remains since he died in custody shortly after his second arrest. On Saturday, under gray skies, Willie was finally given two things that had been denied him for more than a century: a proper burial and a name. Kyle Blankenbiller, the funeral home’s director, said researchers are near certain that Stoneman Willie was James Murphy, a New Yorker of Irish descent who was in Reading for a convention. Mr. Blankenbiller acknowledged that, clinically speaking, Willie is a mummy. The mystery of his identity has only added to his lore. He has been treated as a ghost story, a freak show and a roadside attraction over the years, but on Saturday, Willie was interred among other sons and daughters of Reading at the Forest Hills Memorial Park cemetery. A granite tombstone was placed at his gravesite with both of his names, and a large informational bronze relief detailing his story will eventually be installed, too. He may have been cast into a caricature, but before James Murphy became Stoneman Willie, he was a just a tourist. It is believed that he was in Reading for a state convention of firefighters. A known alcoholic, he was arrested twice that week — on Oct. 1 for public drunkenness, and on Oct. 7 for burglarizing the Morris Brown Boarding House. Willie gave his age as 37 and his name either as James Penn or William Penn, which could explain how he got his nickname, said George Meiser IX, the Berks County historian. Willie died in the Berks County Prison on Nov. 19. The official cause of death was kidney failure. But because he used a fake name, his family was never notified and his body was released to Mr. Auman’s funeral home. At the time, Mr. Auman was experimenting with a new technique developed during the Civil War for preserving bodies. But the embalming formula he used, found in a German medical journal that detailed how to preserve meat, did way more than it was supposed to. Testing later revealed that the formula he used included high levels of formalin, cyanide and arsenic. The result, Mr. Blankenbiller said, is that “if you touch him, he’s like stone, he’s hard as wood.” “He weighs nothing,” he said. “He’s that petrified.” Auman’s Funeral Home had considered burying Willie before but a plan began to coalesce just before the start of the pandemic. Mr. Blankenbiller and local historians set to work figuring out who Willie really was, combing through prison and funeral home records and other documents to piece together Willie’s story. Mr. Auman had always identified him as James Murphy, but Mr. Blankenbiller said that identity had never been definitively confirmed. Part of the confusion arose from the fact that Mr. Auman had prepared the body of another prisoner named Michael Pohouski around the same time. Local cemetery records showed that Pohouski was “definitely buried,” Mr. Blankenbiller said. Mr. Blankenbiller said Willie had mentioned to his cellmate that he had a brother and a sister in Manhattan and another sibling in Brooklyn. Mr. Blankenbiller was able to find evidence that one of those relatives, Donald Murphy, was living in Manhattan at the time. Once Mr. Blankenbiller was able to definitively say that Pohouski was not Willie, he knew he had the right guy. James Murphy may have been from New York, but Willie has been a son of Reading for 128 years. Alexa Freyman, 32, grew up in Reading hearing stories about Willie from her parents and grandparents. There were tales, she said, about how his fingernails and hair were still growing. Ms. Freyman finally got a look for herself in May when the funeral home announced plans to bury Willie. “It sounds silly but it’s something you can share with your parents and grandparents, and it’s something they shared with their grandparents and parents,” she said. “It’s morbid, but it was something that brought us together and gave us some sort of reference historically to who we were and what happened here then.” Mr. Meiser said he first saw Willie in 1949 when he and a few of his friends from junior high school asked to see him. “It was a rite of passage,” he said. “Everyone had to go see Stoneman Willie.” In the days leading up to the burial, visitors had one last chance to pay their respects to Willie as he lay in repose in a coffin at Auman’s, dressed in a tuxedo that dates to the 1890s and likely weighs more than he does. There were signs, however, that Willie wasn’t ready to go just yet. Last Sunday, Willie was the centerpiece of a parade celebrating Reading’s 275th anniversary. But the elevator to get Willie from the funeral home’s second floor broke down. Then the hearse overheated and had to be towed to a mechanic. Arrangements were made for Willie to make his way through the city in a motorcycle-drawn hearse. Halfway through the parade, the motorcycle died, and a backup hearse had to be called. “As much as we’re sad about it, we really feel we honored him in the way that he deserved after all of this time,” Mr. Blankenbiller said after the burial service. It rained on Saturday morning but the sun later came out as Mr. Blankenbiller and other staff members headed back to the funeral home. They took it as one more sign. '),(16,'Two Families Got Fed Up With Their States’ Politics. So They Moved Out.','The Nobles of Iowa moved to blue Minnesota. The Huckinses of Oregon moved to red Missouri. Their separate journeys, five weeks apart, illustrate the fracturing of America.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/politics-states-moving.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 14:08:11 +0000','Steve Huckins, a native of Oregon, was preparing to move across the country when he went on Facebook to post a goodbye letter of sorts to his home state. “I had planned to die here,” Mr. Huckins, 59, wrote. “It’s a beautiful state. The mountains, the lakes, the rivers, the beaches. All are overshadowed by the societal and political climate.” Mr. Huckins and his wife, Ginger, were leaving Portland, Ore., one of the most progressive cities in the United States. They said Portland’s tolerance of homeless encampments, along with the open use of hard drugs and rising crime, had filled them with despair. So they headed 2,000 miles east, to deep-red rural Missouri. Driving around their new hometown in June, about an hour outside St. Louis, they admired the old Victorians and a tractor defying the minimum speed limit on a state road. “One thing I do like about Missouri, there’s lots of American flags,” Mr. Huckins said as he steered around a traffic circle where the Stars and Stripes flapped crisply on a pole. “In Portland, the American flag was offensive.” One day earlier, in a neighboring state, another couple making a politically motivated move had a different flag on display — a Pride flag on a T-shirt. Jennie and Jeff Noble were packing their possessions into a 26-foot U-Haul truck in suburban Iowa. Ms. Noble, 37, who was wearing the Pride T-shirt, and her husband were leaving Iowa for Minnesota. Their only child, Julien, came out as transgender at age 11. Now 16, Julien uses prescription testosterone. After Iowa banned gender-affirming medical care for minors, criminalizing their son’s treatments, the Nobles — lifelong Iowans — concluded they had to get out. “We are leaving due to the local politics affecting our son,” Ms. Noble said. “We are moving to Minnesota where the laws are more favorable.” Americans are increasingly fracturing as a people, and some are taking the extraordinary step of moving to escape a political or social climate they abhor. Democrats have left Iowa, Texas and other red states as Republicans have moved out of California, Oregon and other blue states, often over their views on issues like abortion, transgender rights, school curriculums, guns, race and a host of other matters. While there is no precise count of how many Americans have relocated because of politics and social issues, interviews with demographers and people who have moved or are considering moving, as well as a review of social-media postings and polling, show the phenomenon is real. Jesse Jordan, of Tennessee, said he and his fiancée had considered moving to Oregon after Tennessee leaders adopted a near-total abortion ban, with no exception for a fatal fetal abnormality. “It has become kind of unthinkable for us to pursue a pregnancy in this state,” Mr. Jordan said. Brian Schmidt, a Navy veteran in rural Iowa, who is white, is saving money so he and his wife, who is of Asian and Mexican descent, can move with their 5-year-old son to a more diverse city in a blue state. Matthew Krall, an accountant, has no regrets about moving his family in 2019 to Tennessee from California, where he was frustrated by that state’s Democratic governor and liberal policies. When Mr. Krall and his neighbors discuss politics now in his conservative suburb outside Nashville, “it’s more of an agreeable conversation,” he said. In a poll in March for the Axios-Ipsos Two Americas Index, four out of 10 adults said they were somewhat or very likely to move to a state more aligned with their political beliefs. The survey found that a majority of adults, 54 percent, were likely to move if their state passed laws that negatively affected them. “I think what Americans are reporting is that politics is a factor in these very, very important residential choices,” said Justin Gest, a George Mason University government professor who advises the Two Americas Index. The Huckins family and the Noble family have not met, yet their journeys — from blue Oregon to red Missouri, and from red Iowa to blue Minnesota — mirror each other, unfolding only five weeks apart this spring. One family relocated because of a single issue — restrictions on transgender rights — while the other believed a broad swath of progressive policies had degraded their quality of life. But both families used strikingly similar language to describe their main concern: the need for personal safety. For the Huckins family, Portland became “unsafe, unsanitary and scary,” Mr. Huckins said. “We had five or six security cameras in our house.” For the Noble family, it was their son’s safety that worried them, as Iowa Republicans passed anti-transgender laws and used what they felt was dehumanizing rhetoric. “We’ve been here our whole lives,” Ms. Noble said before the move. “Our families are here, friends are here, jobs are here. But when it came down to it, we have to support our son. We have to keep him safe.” On a Wednesday in late August, four months after their move, Ms. Huckins and her husband took a drive to a farm called Shared Bounty, several miles from their new home in Troy, Mo., a city of 15,000 in Lincoln County. They have been married for 15 years: He retired from a warehouse job with the Army Corps of Engineers last year because of heart problems; she’s the daughter of a minister and ran a day care center. At the farm, which sells vegetables, milk and preserves, they didn’t see a worker around. So Ms. Huckins picked out a tomato, weighed it and wrote her purchase in a ledger. Payment was on the honor system, the kind of transaction they would have never imagined in Portland. “It still floors me,” Ms. Huckins said. In Portland, they lived on the east side in the Centennial neighborhood, where the crime rate is high relative to the rest of the city, according to the police. Their single-story house with brown siding was both home and business: Ms. Huckins operated Ginger’s Joyful Day Care there for 33 years. The yard held a swing set and other play structures for the children. Inside, pint-size furniture and bins of toys filled brightly painted rooms. Although the small lot was enclosed with a chain-link fence, Ms. Huckins insisted on inspecting the grounds each day before letting the children out to play. “I had to make sure some addict hadn’t thrown a needle in the yard,” she said. When a thief stole the catalytic converter out of Mr. Huckins’s Ford pickup, they installed security cameras, two of which monitored the front porch. They moved the truck behind a gate, then padlocked the gate. “People wanted liberalism in Portland, and they got it,” Mr. Huckins said. “They’ve got an out-of-control homeless problem. They’ve got an out-of-control fentanyl problem. They’ve got a lack of police.” The couple said the quality of life in Portland and their neighborhood deteriorated after months of protests, some violent, following the 2020 killing of George Floyd. “We had riots within blocks of our house,” Mr. Huckins said. In 2020, Oregon voters approved a measure to decriminalize possession of hard drugs for personal use. Homelessness, a challenge to many cities, is rampant in Portland, which for years took a hands-off attitude toward tent camping on sidewalks. Twenty million dollars was cut from the police department’s budget in 2020 amid calls to “defund the police.” Mr. Huckins became a frequent consumer of social media feeds that were devoted to Portland’s problems. While he was confined at home because of his health during the Covid pandemic, he binged on outrages. He commented angrily on Facebook last year about a news story that described how marchers dressed in black broke windows during a protest. The same month, Mr. Huckins posted home-security video of a young man in a hoodie approaching one of his cars in front of his house overnight, apparently trying to break in. In the end, Mr. Huckins and his wife were not driven to give up on Portland by a single incident. The last straw may have been a state effort to charge tolls on Interstate highways in the city. It came on top of a tripling of their property taxes in recent years. They believed liberal politicians were leaning on homeowners to pay for programs that enabled homelessness and crime. “They cut my police force for their agenda,” Mr. Huckins said. For years, Ms. Huckins’s daughter from her first marriage, Stacee Hord, had encouraged her mother and stepfather to move to Missouri, where her young family had settled. After resolving to move out of Portland late last year, Missouri was the obvious choice of a destination for the Huckinses because of their three grandchildren. Mr. Huckins posted about the impending move on Facebook the day after New Year’s. “It’s exciting, scary and unsettling,” he wrote. Since relocating to Troy, Mr. Huckins has unfollowed all the Portland news feeds that agitated him during his Oregon days. On Facebook, he gleefully posted his $9 bill for weekly garbage pickup in Missouri, writing, “We paid $60 a month in Portland.” Their new home is in a subdivision named The Hamptons, carved from corn fields, with wide streets and sidewalks. “My pickup, I left it parked and unlocked on the street for three or four days,” Mr. Huckins said. “It was not ransacked. It was not stolen.” Mr. Huckins and his wife now spend much of their days at home, watching TV in his-and-hers reclining chairs. Their living room is a tidy space decorated with Ms. Huckins’s figurines and dollhouse pieces. The kitchen had so many of her refrigerator magnets that dozens were exiled to the back of the door leading to the garage. Ms. Huckins’s grandchildren — ages 10, 8 and 3 — visit often and play in the craft room she set up in the basement. “Living here is a whole different environment,” Mr. Huckins said. “We have new dreams, new visions, new thoughts.” Neither he nor his wife had any regrets about their move. “It’s so much better here — financially, emotionally, mentally,” he said. When they tell people they relocated from Oregon, they often receive a similar response: “Welcome to our red state.” Not long ago, Mr. Huckins met a local police officer and mentioned that he had moved to Missouri from Oregon. The officer rolled his eyes and uttered an expletive. One day in early March, Republican lawmakers in Iowa passed a law banning gender-affirming care for minors. Supporters argued that people under 18 were too immature to make decisions about treatments, which can include puberty blockers, sex-specific hormones and surgeries. As the news broke that afternoon, Julien Noble, a 16-year-old who had been taking prescription testosterone under a doctor’s care, sent his parents a text: “Can we move to Minnesota?” It had been nearly five years since Julien had come out as transgender to his parents, on the day before Mother’s Day. His mother’s reaction was complex but instinctively supportive. “Obviously with any of this, there’s a grief, you know,” Ms. Noble said, adding, “But I knew he would be so much happier.” Delaying medical treatments until he was legally an adult, Julien said, would have prolonged the unhappiness he felt since recognizing his identity in early adolescence. “I was so sure of myself at like 11 or 12,” Julien said. “If I were to wait until I was 18, that’s, like, six more years of lagging behind and not feeling secure about anything.” With the treatments, he added, “I can, like, go to the grocery store and not be nervous that everyone’s like, ‘He’s a girl!’” A transition that began in middle school with Julien cropping his hair short and practicing a deeper voice in his bedroom progressed to a legal name change last year. The family’s pediatrician required him to undergo a year of psychotherapy before beginning hormone injections. “We could see he was not going to change his mind,” Ms. Noble said. “This is who he is.” Julien’s parents married fresh out of high school in rural northwest Iowa. Mr. Noble worked in the meat department of a supermarket. Ms. Noble studied online to be a paralegal. When they were growing up, Iowa was a leader in civil rights, legalizing same-sex marriage in 2009 and adding protections for transgender people to the state’s Civil Rights Act in 2007. They were barely aware of partisan divides in their native Cherokee County. “I just don’t remember it being political at all, like it wasn’t a thing,” said Mr. Noble, 38, whose meat-cutting job gave way to a career in computer software. “I used to think I’d want to live here all of my life because people were so nice.” But since the 2016 presidential election, when Donald J. Trump easily carried the state, Iowa has tilted sharply rightward. The state passed a six-week abortion ban in 2018, at the time one of the strictest in the nation, and a law allowing adults to buy and carry handguns without a permit was passed in 2021. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, made restrictions on transgender youth central to her agenda the past two years. In response to Julien’s text in March, his parents said they would keep an eye on the legislation to ban treatments for minors. They believed it was possible the governor might not sign it. Still, they debated leaving Iowa. For seven happy years, they had lived in Ankeny, a rapidly growing suburb of Des Moines, buying a home on a corner lot in a subdivision called White Birch. Minnesota was close and familiar, just a three-hour drive away. And the suburbs of Minneapolis were similar to those ringing Des Moines, though politically they were more blue than red. On the same day that Iowa lawmakers acted in March, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, issued an executive order to protect gender-affirming treatments for minors in his state. The Nobles weighed whether they could simply wait things out until Julien was 18, driving to Minneapolis for his biweekly testosterone shots. That way he could finish his senior year at Ankeny High School, where he had a circle of friends who supported one other. During a trip back to Cherokee County to visit his parents, Mr. Noble and his wife told them that they were thinking of leaving because of the legislation. Charles Noble — his 70-year-old father, and Julien’s grandfather — said he and his wife were fully supportive of the move, to ensure Julien’s happiness. “Jules is still our grandchild, and we love him just the same,” he said. But Iowa lawmakers soon passed another bill: The G.O.P. majority barred students from using restrooms that did not align with their biological sex. The bathroom bill tipped the Noble family toward their decision to leave. Since Julien had begun using testosterone, his voice had deepened and his sideburns had grown in. “It would be awkward if he were in the female restroom,” his mother said. In late March, Ms. Reynolds signed both bills into law. That night, the Nobles made the decision to put their house up for sale. They chose a moving date in June, a few days after the end of Julien’s junior year. They planned to keep their jobs and work remotely. In the Twin Cities suburb of Apple Valley where they had rented a home, Julien would enter his new school at the start of his senior year. Like any new student, he was nervous. “It depends on the day, it depends on the hour how I feel,” Julien said. “Minnesota is, like, great. And it’s, like, safe and it’s lovely. And like our new house is cool. But then it’s like I have to go to a new school and do the whole thing again, and try to meet new friends.” In late August, the gym at Eastview High School in Apple Valley rocked with the cheers of hundreds of students and their families. To welcome newcomers, the school staged a pep rally with its marching band and its state-champion dance team. It was two days before the start of a new school year, and Julien, after spending several weeks in Chicago at an art school over the summer, was there with his parents, sitting high up in the bleachers. The family had started settling into Apple Valley, with Ms. Noble finding new friends through a Facebook group. Most of the students at the rally were freshmen. Julien was a senior transfer student. Afterward, a student guide wearing a backward baseball cap gave Julien and two other newcomers a tour. The student guide pointed out “my favorite room in the building — the wrestling room.” Julien described his new school as “a bunch of sports teams that sometimes teaches classes.” His father tried to be reassuring. “I’m sure it’ll be fun once you get to know some people,” he told his son. The Nobles said they had no second thoughts about leaving Iowa. While driving to a barbecue in Minneapolis for her Facebook group, Ms. Noble had been pleased to see Pride and Black Lives Matter signs. Like the Huckins family, the Nobles had stopped closely following political news from their old state. When people asked why they had moved, Ms. Noble said she kept it vague, saying simply that the state was a better fit for her family. “I told some people that I’ve gotten to know the real reason why,” Ms. Noble said. “But it’s hard. I mean, so many people are still so hateful and not supportive.” Mr. Noble still seemed stunned that in America in 2023, politics would drive a family to seek refuge across state lines. “I don’t quite understand how it got so crazy,” he said. He didn’t even know if his parents were Democrats or Republicans when he was growing up. His son was more concerned with the effect than the cause. “It’s like we’re one country on paper,” Julien said. “But we’re not really.” '),(17,'A Curious Censorship Issue at the Guantánamo Court','A prisoner’s PTSD was discussed in open court, and was central to a ruling that he was unfit for trial. National security censors redacted it.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/censorship-guantanamo-court.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 12:50:03 +0000','When a judge disqualified a prisoner last month from being part of the conspiracy case in the Sept. 11 attacks, the ruling was based on one finding: a mental health board’s diagnosis that the man, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, had post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet, when the Pentagon released a transcript of a pretrial hearing this week where the diagnosis was discussed, every mention of PTSD was blacked out. It’s the latest example of a sometimes baffling pick-and-choose approach by censors to the public record that emerges from Guantánamo Bay. On Sept. 19, reporters, families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and a law student were all watching the proceedings from the spectators’ gallery at court when lawyers mentioned “PTSD” or “post-traumatic stress disorder” nine times in two hours. A court security officer never pushed the mute button on the audio, which spectators hear after a 40-second delay. The delay is a feature of the Guantánamo court, not used in U.S. criminal courts, to prevent the disclosure of classified information. But when the Pentagon released the “unofficial/unauthenticated transcript” on its military commissions website, only a secondary diagnosis endorsed by prosecutors survived the censor’s marker. “He has a delusional disorder,” Clayton G. Trivett Jr., a lead prosecutor, said. “It does not make him incompetent. It does not make him unable to cooperate intelligently in his defense.” Redactions of the public record are the work of a shadowy organization called the SCDRT, or the Security Classification/Declassification Review Team. For years, the Pentagon typically posted transcripts of public hearings within 24 hours, sometimes on the same day. But it can take weeks or months for security officials to redact transcripts when public testimony involves the inner workings of Guantánamo’s prison or the C.I.A.’s overseas secret prison network, known as the black sites, where prisoners were tortured. There was no immediate explanation for the redactions of PTSD. David I. Bruck, Mr. bin al-Shibh’s lawyer, has said that his client’s condition resulted from “years and years of solitary confinement” and other forms of torture in the black sites. Because the judge removed Mr. bin al-Shibh from the case, four men now face a joint prosecution. The lead defendant is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. In court on Friday, Gary D. Sowards, a lawyer for Mr. Mohammed, said the unseen censors were using redactions “for public relations and tactical considerations, not for national security.” “The C.I.A. tortured people to the mental incapacity to stand trial,” he said. The prosecution did not respond. But Col. Matthew N. McCall, the judge, replied that he did not reach that conclusion when he ruled that Mr. bin al-Shibh was mentally unfit and removed him from the case. The judge said he had found no need to link any of the prisoner’s diagnoses to the C.I.A. program. Colonel McCall agreed that some redactions “made very little sense” because the information that was blacked out drew no national security objections at the time it was spoken. “I will see what I can put out to see that those kind of redactions aren’t being made,” he said, noting that the court transcripts are handled by “a different entity.” '),(18,'After McCarthy Ouster as House Speaker, Will the Motion to Vacate Change?','Some Republicans are calling for the weapon that dethroned Kevin McCarthy to be weakened.

The move initiated a successful coup, as a rebel bloc of eight Republican hard-liners joined with Democrats to declare the speaker’s chair vacant, thus forcing Mr. McCarthy out. Now the fate of that rule is becoming a pivotal part of the debate surrounding the selection of a new speaker who would be at the mercy of the same unforgiving math if nothing changes. In the aftermath of Mr. McCarthy’s toppling, many more mainstream Republicans have demanded that the chamber dump the single-member motion to vacate, as Democrats did when they controlled the House. They argue that a change would prevent the next speaker from finding themselves in the same circumstances as Mr. McCarthy’s when, as is likely, they must cut some sort of deal with Democrats on government funding that the hard right finds objectionable. They see the election of a new speaker as a moment to at least begin considering overhauling a rule that most House Republicans believe led to Mr. McCarthy being undeservedly deposed. “Whoever the new speaker is is going to be held hostage on this,” said Representative Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska. “It should be eliminated.” He was one of 45 House Republicans who signed a letter to their G.O.P. colleagues on Friday demanding unspecified “fundamental changes to the structure of our majority” to prevent a repeat of what happened to Mr. McCarthy, thought they did not mention the motion to vacate. Another signatory, Representative Carlos Gimenez, Republican of Florida, went further on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter. “The person who wants my vote for Speaker must commit to reforming the motion to vacate,” he wrote in a post pinned to the top of his feed. “The threshold must be raised to 50% of the Republican Conference. A Speaker cannot govern under constant threat by fringe hostage takers.” The Republican Main Street Caucus also weighed in on X, calling the rule a “chokehold” and saying that “any candidate for Speaker must explain to us how what happened on Tuesday will never happen again.” Yet so far, the two leading candidates for the post, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, do not appear eager to get out in front on this inflammatory issue. They said it should be left up to House Republicans to make the call. “We will have to decide as 222 Republicans, are we going to change that?” Mr. Jordan said on Fox News. “That’s the only way it gets done, if that’s what the conference wants.” The problem for Mr. Scalise, Mr. Jordan and anyone else who wants to be elected speaker is that it would take 217 votes to change the rule. There are currently 221 Republicans in the House, with one seat vacant. Eight Republicans deployed the rule to undo Mr. McCarthy. Members of that bloc might be reluctant to make any changes, since the rule is the very thing that empowers them. But Mr. Gaetz, the architect of Mr. McCarthy’s demise, told Fox News Digital that he would be “open-minded” about a possible change. And if backing a change costs a speaker candidate more than four votes, they cannot be elected. Republicans could also look to Democrats to help them eliminate or modify the rule, but Mr. Jordan was adamant that would not happen. “I’m not going to go to Democrats to get that done,” he said on Fox News. “No way.” The rule existed for hundreds of years in the House handbook but was used only once before, in 1910 against Speaker Joseph Cannon, who survived. The reason it was never much of a threat previously was because individual House members were not foolhardy enough to try to take on speakers who wielded enormous power and could exact revenge. That changed in 2015, when a bloc of emboldened far-right Republicans threatened to move against Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who eventually stepped aside on his own. When Democrats took back the majority in 2018 and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California returned as the speaker, the rules were changed to require the agreement of a majority of a party conference or caucus to force action on a motion to vacate. But it was hard to imagine Ms. Pelosi facing such a rebellion at all. Mr. McCarthy, fighting to be elected speaker in January, wanted to stick with that threshold to protect himself. But right-wing holdouts insisted on restoring the single-member motion, and he reluctantly agreed in his desperation to win them over, ultimately sealing his fate. Republicans included a nonbinding policy in their conference rules that a motion to vacate “should only be available with the agreement of the Republican Conference so as to not allow Democrats to choose the speaker.” But that statement is easily ignored, as Mr. Gaetz demonstrated. Some Republicans say they should stick with the current rule. “Congress ought not fear the MTV,” Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, said on X, using shorthand for the motion. With the debate intensifying, some conservative groups who work to elect Republicans are also urging lawmakers to stand firm. David M. McIntosh, a former congressman from Indiana who is the president of the Club for Growth, said on X that his organization would “oppose any candidate for Speaker of the House who supports a return to Pelosi’s rules.” But many House Republicans believe that without at least raising the bar for bringing forward a resolution to remove the speaker, they will quickly find themselves in the same predicament. Mr. McCarthy’s ouster confirmed their belief that caving to the hard right in the first place was a terrible mistake. “I thought it was bad in January,” said Mr. Bacon, the representative from Nebraska. He noted the difference in what it would have taken to challenge Ms. Pelosi compared with Mr. McCarthy: “We went from 112 to 1. It was absurd.” '),(19,'California Could Install Speed Cameras as Pedestrian Deaths Spike','A bill to install cameras has landed on the governor’s desk at a moment when pedestrian deaths are spiking nationwide.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/california-speed-cameras-pedestrians.html','Sat, 07 Oct 2023 09:02:41 +0000','California likes to think of itself as a cutting-edge lab for policymaking, a place where laws get passed first and then copied around the country. But for years, it has banned a basic measure used in many cities to slow drivers: the humble speed camera. In the state that practically invented car culture and the thrill of hitting the open road, speed cameras have faced steep resistance. That could now change, as a bill to install cameras on a trial basis has landed on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk at a moment when pedestrian deaths are spiking nationwide, but especially in California. Fueled by faster, riskier drivers, bigger vehicles and less police enforcement of traffic laws, pedestrian deaths nationwide rose 77 percent to 7,624 deaths from 2010 to 2021, according to federal data. In California alone, 1,100 pedestrians died in crashes last year, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association, a nonprofit that represents states’ safety offices. The legislation on Governor Newsom’s desk, which he has until Oct. 14 to sign or veto, would allow a handful of cities including San Francisco and Los Angeles to install cameras on a trial basis. A spokeswoman for the governor said he doesn’t comment on pending legislation. If signed, the legislation would allow California to join 205 communities in 21 states where speed cameras are in use and have been widely credited with slowing drivers. Some of the loudest supporters of the bill are families of victims who have been killed by cars. Liz Chavez struggles to talk about the worst day of her life: May 13, 2013, when a speeding driver in a Lexus S.U.V. struck and killed her 5-year-old daughter in a school crosswalk in San Jose, Calif.  That afternoon, Aileen and her younger sister Ariana were walking with Ms. Chavez’s sister-in-law to pick up their older sister from school. The driver struck all three, instantly killing Aileen. Ms. Chavez’s sister-in-law ended up in the hospital with broken ribs, perforated organs and a concussion. Ariana also suffered a concussion. Ms. Chavez, who still cries when saying her daughter’s name, has photos of Aileen around her home and talks about her often to her youngest child, 8-year-old Alexis. She tells him about how Aileen was a shy, quiet girl who loved soccer and gospel music and carried a Bible with her wherever she went. “Even though he didn’t get to meet her, he says he misses her,” Ms. Chavez said.  Ms. Chavez has since traveled to the Capitol building in Sacramento repeatedly to try to convince politicians to allow speed cameras. “It might not reduce the number of deaths to zero,” she said. “But this does actually work.” Previous efforts dating back six years have failed after opponents expressed concerns about privacy and equity. Human Rights Watch sent a letter earlier this year to the Senate saying speed cameras would increase the surveillance state and issue fines to people who can’t afford them. “Communities need investments in public transportation and traffic calming infrastructure — not cameras — to keep them safe,” the group said in the letter. In 2014, the city of San Francisco committed to a plan to eliminate traffic deaths by the end of 2024. With just about a year left to that deadline, the goal remains far out of reach. In 2014, 31 people died in traffic crashes, with 21 of them being pedestrians. Last year, 39 people, including 20 pedestrians, died in collisions. So far this year, there have been 14 pedestrian deaths — including a 4-year-old girl being pushed by her father in a stroller near the Giants baseball stadium in August. “The fact that so many innocent lives are lost from something that’s preventable is honestly criminal and heartbreaking,” said Jodie Medeiros, executive director of Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy nonprofit. The speed camera program would not be run by the police, but by cities’ transportation departments. Drivers going 11 miles per hour above the posted speed limit would receive tickets, with fines starting at $50 and increasing for higher speeds. They would be like parking tickets, with no points being added to one’s driving record. The program would allow cities to reduce fines for low-income people or allow them to complete community service hours instead. Other cities like New York have had speed cameras for years. A decade ago, Juan Martinez, a former policy director in New York City’s Department of Transportation, helped pioneer the cameras in school zones. There are now more than 2,000 around the city. As drivers became aware of them, fewer tickets were issued, and the cameras were proven to lower drivers’ speeds, said Mr. Martinez. On average, speeding at fixed camera locations has dropped 73 percent since the cameras were installed. Pedestrian deaths are still a major issue in the city, but the number has come down since cameras were introduced. Last year, 118 pedestrians died in New York City, compared to 184 in 2013. “If you care about preventing people from getting killed in crashes, the thing you do is focus on speed,” Mr. Martinez said. '),(20,'California’s New Senator Was a Labor Leader. Why Are Unions Upset With Her?','Laphonza Butler was part of Uber’s push to avoid having to classify its drivers as employees. Her new appointment has drawn ire from labor advocates.','https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/laphonza-butler-uber-lobbying.html','Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:01:34 +0000','In the summer of 2019, Uber, Lyft and other companies that use contract drivers faced a crisis in California. The State Legislature was poised to pass a law that would effectively require them to treat their drivers as employees, meaning the gig companies would have to pay drivers a minimum wage, cover their expenses and contribute to state unemployment — all significant new costs. Desperate for a way out, the companies pushed legislators to exempt their drivers from the new law, saying they faced huge economic losses. But they wanted the backing of the state’s unions for the exemption, and promised to extend some new benefits for drivers if the unions got on board. So Uber brought in a team of high-powered consultants, including one whose connections with organized labor were unimpeachable: Laphonza Butler, the former president of California’s largest union, a branch of the Service Employees International Union. Ms. Butler, working through a prominent California consulting firm, advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives, according to those familiar with the negotiations. The overture to labor divided union activists, some of whom bristled at negotiating with the companies, and ultimately, it failed. But Ms. Butler’s chapter with Uber proved to be a pivotal moment in her career, moving from labor activism to the world of high-powered political consulting, which also involved a role in advising Vice President Kamala Harris in her 2020 presidential campaign.  On Sunday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that he was naming Ms. Butler as the state’s next senator, replacing Dianne Feinstein, who died last week. Many Democrats cheered the appointment of Ms. Butler, the third Black woman to serve in the Senate and a prominent figure in Democratic politics for more than a decade who most recently served as president of Emily’s List, the political action committee that works to elect women and candidates who support abortion rights. But the appointment has also drawn ire from labor advocates, who have not forgotten Ms. Butler’s work consulting with Uber, which some saw as an uncomfortable reversal from her history in the labor movement and the values she promoted there. “The sense was she was betraying her commitment to working people,” said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, who has argued that Uber’s drivers should be classified as employees. “She sold out in a really big way.” The negotiations Ms. Butler was involved in eventually fell apart, and the gig companies turned to a ballot initiative with similar provisions, Proposition 22, that voters passed the following year.  Supporters of Ms. Butler said her time consulting for Uber was scarcely a blip compared with her long history of labor advocacy, which includes organizing hundreds of thousands of workers in nursing homes and home-based care and successfully pushing for a statewide $15-per-hour minimum wage. “Labor hasn’t had a union leader in the Senate in 60 years — let alone a union president who spent nearly two decades leading successful campaigns to raise the minimum wage and help workers organize,” said Jeffrey Lerner, the acting chief of staff for Ms. Butler. “That’s Senator Butler’s résumé and those are her values.” Ms. Butler declined to be interviewed for this article but told The San Francisco Chronicle this week that she believed gig drivers “should have the protections of employment,” and said her role with Uber “was one that was consistent with my résumé.” Uber also declined to comment. In 2019, Mr. Newsom’s administration encouraged the gig companies and labor unions to work out their differences over the issue, several people involved in the discussions said. Uber and Lyft wanted to persuade the unions to back a bill they could bring to the Legislature that would exempt their drivers from Assembly Bill 5, which would treat many categories of gig workers, like freelance writers and janitors, as employees for the purposes of employment law. In exchange for the exemption, the gig companies would agree that the drivers could receive some limited benefits and join “network driver advocacy organizations” in which the state’s unions would represent them and negotiate for some labor rights. Ms. Butler was brought in as well, with Uber paying the team at the consulting firm where she worked, SCRB Strategies, now known as Bearstar Strategies,  $185,000 in 2019 and 2020. She was seen essentially as a translator, helping company managers understand the subtleties of labor leaders’ positions and frame arguments in ways that would appeal to the unions, according to several people familiar with the discussions, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss internal Uber issues or did not want to air internal conflicts in the labor movement. One person said Ms. Butler was expected to take on other tasks as well, including talking with her former union colleagues about a possible compromise. It was also expected that she might help with a public relations strategy to persuade lawmakers and the general public that AB-5 could have negative effects on gig workers, though it was not clear whether she agreed to do so. Ms. Butler participated in occasional conference calls with the company’s public affairs team, according to two people with knowledge of the calls. She answered their questions and advised Uber to use fewer vague tech industry buzzwords and be more straightforward in communicating with the unions.  Ms. Butler told the Uber employees that she would help them as long as it did not betray her values, one of the people recalled. Still, Ms. Butler’s presence on the other side of the negotiating table rankled many of the state’s most prominent labor unions, several union officials said, although they did not want to discuss the matter publicly because they did not want to cross Mr. Newsom and Ms. Butler. The months of discussions stretched from consultants’ offices in Sacramento to hotels in Oakland and the headquarters of Uber and Salesforce in San Francisco. They included large group negotiations, forums for drivers to share their views with labor organizers and smaller sit-downs between the unions’ top negotiators and gig company executives, including John Zimmer, the former president of Lyft, and Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer and the brother-in-law of Vice President Harris. Ms. Butler’s role during the meetings she attended was minimal, according to several people. She sat on the sidelines listening, exchanged brief niceties with the union leaders she knew and once made introductions during a meeting in which drivers gave their perspective to the two parties. Leaders of S.E.I.U., the union where Ms. Butler had formerly worked, were the most amenable to cutting a deal, according to two people involved in the discussions. But many other unions were strongly opposed, fearing they were bargaining away crucial employment rights for vulnerable workers. The talks fizzled out. Assembly Bill 5 passed that fall and took effect the following year, but Uber and Lyft eventually got what they wanted anyway, joining DoorDash to spend more than $200 million on Prop. 22, passed by voters in 2020, which maintained gig drivers’ status as independent contractors and provided them limited benefits, like a wage floor and some health insurance stipends. The measure is currently facing a legal challenge. Ms. Butler was not involved in the Prop. 22 campaign and left the consulting firm in 2020 to become a director of public policy at Airbnb, the short-term home rental company launched in San Francisco. Like Uber, Airbnb has faced regulatory heat in Democratic, union-friendly strongholds like New York, where the company was being blamed for pushing up rents for working class residents and hurting hotel jobs. (Airbnb has said many other factors have caused rents to rise in New York and that its business model has helped drive down lodging costs for consumers.) One of the company’s chief adversaries in New York had been the Hotel Trades Council, a powerful union. Mary Kay Henry, S.E.I.U.’s international president, said Ms. Butler was a “transformational” labor leader and suggested that her pro-worker voice being part of Uber’s negotiating team may have been a benefit for workers. “She’s who I’d want in the room helping corporations understand what workers want and need,” Ms. Henry said. But the animosity Ms. Butler engendered among organized labor remains, and supporters of those running for the permanent Senate seat — who include Representatives Adam Schiff, Barbara Lee and Katie Porter — have been quick to resurrect the issue. If Ms. Butler runs for a full term, the unions will have to decide whether to support her. Some, including a firefighters’ union, a film set workers’ union and a public transit union have already endorsed Mr. Schiff. The deadline to seek the endorsement of the California Democratic Party was originally Oct. 13, but the party decided this week to push back that date to Oct. 27 to give Ms. Butler time to apply if she decides to run, said Rusty Hicks, the state party’s chair. For some Democrats, Ms. Butler’s appointment draws attention to a deeper messaging problem within the Democratic Party. Mr. Newsom might get credit for appointing an L.G.B.T.Q. Black senator, but her consulting work, to some, highlights the party’s ties to big businesses. “This is why many working class voters have this distaste for the Democratic Party and a lot of them went to Trump,” said Larry Cohen, the former president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers at companies like Verizon and AT&T.  Mr. Cohen is now chairman of Our Revolution, a progressive advocacy group that recently endorsed Ms. Lee. But Anthony York, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, defended the governor’s appointment. “Anyone casting doubt on Senator Butler’s record of fighting for working families either doesn’t know what they’re talking about or has some sort of political ax to grind,” he said.
